10mo9oe,1674834997,For the First time in YEARS I have found myself and feel GREAT.,True,"I felt the need to get this off my chest and for anyone still struggling I PROMISE it gets better...

This might be the first time in 3-4 years where I am truly happy in my life right now. Therapy, surrounding myself with people who love me for me and finally met someone who seems to be the perfect fit for myself. It took me in my darkest days to realize what was going on and that to see those glory days I must withstand the time in my dark days. I am still on lexapro which I would eventually like to get off of and use other forms to release my stress and anxiety. My goal with this is to help at least one person in this subreddit.

I‚Äôve been in antidepressants and anti anxiety medication since I was a child, I‚Äôve managed all of my diagnoses (OCD,GAD,CPTSD) with buspar, Celexa and hydroxazine. Last week I had a massive nervous breakdown and literally NOTHING was helping.

I don‚Äôt have an addictive personality whatsoever, in fact I‚Äôve been prescribed it before and never used a single one but this is different. My psychiatrist wants me to use it (as prescribed obviously) but my therapist is very hesitant. He‚Äôs worried even a few hours of relief from my minute by minute symptoms will be too much of a relief and I‚Äôll become addicted. I don‚Äôt know what to do now.

10mnwvo,1674834135,Just why tho ugh .__.,True,"
I‚Äôm not even sure what the heck is going on in my brain and why. But My anxiety is freakin loud, like I‚Äôm not 100% sure what kind of anxiety I have. because even tho I got diagnosed‚Ä¶I never got told anything specific. Just that oh your have anxiety like thanks doc, helped a lot.üëç 
So I went my whole life with anxiety and later on years down the road didn‚Äôt notice or know that what I was experiencing was severe anxiety. I wouldn‚Äôt even notice I was having panic attacks or anything unless it was actually notice able and I knew. I thought everything I was experiencing wasn‚Äôt even that bad. I just thought I had anxiety and was anxious‚Ä¶. ._. 
But  nope my anxiety is so severe as hell‚Ä¶..
You know you have it bad when you barely take a little tiny bit of Xanax and your whole entire head just stops.  üòê
And not even just your head, your moods too. The irritated and anxious feeling just stops like everything just fricken stopped. ü´†
I literally didn‚Äôt know my head would be saying a bunch of stuff, all going on at once. I didn‚Äôt even notice any of it till I took Xanax sadly‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why I just didn‚Äôt notice. It was literally like night and day. I actually experience what it would be like if I had normal brain and what it actually means to be fine. The worst part is‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt even like my anxiety went away, I was so relax that I was being my real self for once, which is sad. Not even joking when I say it was literally like it changed my whole personality. I went from not showing anything and just closed in like I‚Äôm in a box. To being free and being able to be my real self and not worry. It was like it flipped a switch in my brain I just was relax and didn‚Äôt think about anything and didn‚Äôt care anymore. Literally I was like a whole new person with a whole new personality. What I never thought I was or would be like, just came out. I realize I‚Äôm not that bad like I thought I was.  It was amazing, and I tried every anxiety meds ever. And nothing worked besides Xanax. I even tried mood stabilizer too and just made me more piss and stuff‚Ä¶.So ya,

10mnv0d,1674834011,Any insight please - I had my first panic attack 11 days ago after a build up of anxiety among other things and I am still broken.,True,"Hi everyone, if anyone has any similar stories, recommendations or words of encouragement it would be greatly appreciated.

Just some background: I am early 20s male who exercises regularly with a fairly healthy diet. I also smoke weed once a night after work and all that to just hang out before going to bed. Probably always had lingering anxiety but also never had any issues with sleeping.

Last 11 days ago I had some family drama go on that made me anxious and upset but nothing I wasn't used to honestly. I was also hyper fixated on sleep because I had a trip for work for a few days. I smoked weed just to chill out while I was packing up and had a mega panic attack. I kept my cool and kept packing up and later tried to go to bed but found myself overanalyzing sleep and I barely got any. Heart was pounding out of my chest and my breathing was out of whack. I also haven't smoked since the panic attack and don't think I should. 

I ""woke up"" to start my trip and was in full panic mode. I got through the three days, two nights, that I was there, barely eating or sleeping. I got back last Thursday and have been still a mess recovering from what I can only think of as a panic/anxiety hangover. Since then my appetite has recovered for the most part as I have now been able to eat three meals a day. But my sleep has been anything but ideal. I went to urgent care 5 days ago just to get some relief and they gave me Hydroxyzine. This made me sleepy but also made me get up and have to empty out my whole number 1 and 2 in the bathroom. I also tried calm magnesium, melatonin, zzzquil, all of that and they also don't do much.

I'm now in a phase where I can get so tired that I fall asleep on my own, but I wake up 1-3 hours later wide awake. Then the next few hours I just go in and out of sleep but I am not longer stressed about getting to sleep. My stress and anxiety in the day has also slimmed down each and every day, but I am just so frustrated about the sleep.

I'm hoping that the fact that I'm falling asleep on my own and not stressed about sleep is a sign of improvement but I am trying to see the light as the abnormal sleep schedule has been screwing with me.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10mnv0d/any_insight_please_i_had_my_first_panic_attack_11/,ExpressionReady1490,

So i felt handicapped and was at the doctor all the time to check my heart with ekg's etc etc. With other words, my life was 0 quality.

UNTIL! I changed zoloft out for duloxetine. I dont know where to start. First off, i fell less anxious in general. Second is my motivation to live and achieve things sky rocket. My heart rate got down to a normal 65-85 at rest, and I also went out for a 5 km run today where my heart rate was between 120-135. Also i notice a change in my mood. I am more happy and cant stop myself from smiling out of nowhere sometimes. I wanted to share my story so far (14 days with duloxetine so far)  to maybe motivate you guys to not give up! I know it is hard and I was there myself just a couple of weeks earlier. But there is a light at the end of the tunel! I am very sure that you also can reach that! 


I am aware of that not everyone responds to the same medicine equally but if some of you uses zoloft (sertraline) without and huge effect it is worth talking with your doc about changing them for duloxetine or something else.

10mjgww,1674821989,Afraid to feel anxiety and jealousy at dance event tonight,True,"Hey all,

I've been struggling with anxiety relating to my boyfriend's dance partner over the autumn and winter. We have previously gone to several events all three of us (together with other acquaintances as well), even car-pooling, and I've danced with her as well.

But now it's been several months since her, my boyfriend and I happened to be at the same event. These months have also been my absolute toughest with regards to anxiety and my boyfriend and I have had many discussions about their dancing. A lot of it has been triggered by thoughts of him and her dancing and practicing together, since they dance a very sensual dance, chat a lot about dance on Facebook, and my boyfriend has said they have a strong connection. However these past few weeks we've worked through it and the anxiety I experience has lessened somewhat in intensity and I experience it less frequently. 

Tonight when we're going to this event I'm noticing that I already have anxiety. Not so much because of him dancing with her. I have anxiety about getting anxiety. What if I have a really strong reaction to seeing her (catastrophic thinking) and I get anxiety and won't be able to handle it.

I just need some support and maybe advice for preparing mentally when im afraid to get anxiety at a public event. I have no history at all of social anxiety or getting triggered by big or busy events. 

I want to be able to have a good night out dancing and I worry that the anxiety will just increase over the course of the day and explode when I see her or when I see her and my boyfriend dance.

10mhq0t,1674815407,after 3 years I finally got a panic attack and I'm proud,True,"24M I did not have panic attacks for 3 years after shaking panic disorder out of me. 2 days ago I finally had one it was alot lighter and shorter than what I remember them to be. I did not expect it was a panic attack becouse I did not have one in such a long time so it freaked me out a little it got me off guard. I had the normal symptoms chest pain and shortness of breath only and thinking that I was dieing from pneumonia becouse I'm currently very sick. I don't use medication becouse they don't cure this type of disorder. I was genuinely surprised after having it that I'm not afraid of getting another attack again this means that I have fully broken the fear of fear loop that causes panic attacks. It's uncomfortable but not dangerous there is 0 reason to be afraid of them or stress about them. I broken panic disorder by stoping medication as advice by a panic disorder specialist and face tank them without giving one step back to my fears. Exposure helped me overcome the developed agoraphobias and fears as well. My exposure therapy was home made I did not pay anything to learn how to do them it's all on the internet for free. I'm sharing this story to inspire sufferers that there is really hope that it gets better overtime if you just try to recover and not stand behind meds and hope for the best. Everything is in the way we think. If your living in constant fear of something your bound to have an panic or anxiety attack you have to do something about it. Pills will just delay or worsen the problem they won't change the way you think after you stop them. Panic disorder is the most treated disorder of all time with the highest success rate let that sink in. I have no understanding of genetic panic disorder so I can't say anything about it or how its treated. Talk therapy has the lowest success rate for panic disorder, exposure has the highest followed closed by reaction prevention meaning don't react in any way to the attacks but don't ignore them just don't go oh I can't breath or anything just keep doing what your doing this way your telling the brain that everything is fine and that there is no reason to fire up adrenaline. This is my 4 years experience with panic disorder and the things I've learned over the years. I hope this inspires everyone and brings their head up high that they will recover or make it alot better than what it's used to be. I'm highly against medication but don't feel ashamed for using pills we all know how hard it is to live with a disorder like this and how debilitating it gets but try your very best to improve and overcome it. Don't just pray for the pills to do it for you there is no evidence that pills fully cure this disorder after stoping the pill.

Even in my house I become stressed when other people are home.

I‚Äôm in college and have the most stressful thoughts every night before sleeping about going to class in the morning. Since I don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing anything with others, my main recreation is taking walks at weird hours when no neighbors are out and becoming sort of nocturnal to avoid my family.

Even when I‚Äôm alone watching tv, and I see a commercial showing people too close outside or in the same room, I feel myself getting queasy. 

I had to quit my summer job as well because I got so much anxiety every time a customer came in and got close to me. This stressed me out when thinking about my future too. What life can I have when I can‚Äôt physically be near other people? 

Back when this started, my therapist at the time suggested exposure therapy to slowly get me used to people. It didn‚Äôt work. Trying again soon with my new therapist, but I feel like I get worse an worse everyday.

It's been a chicken and the egg story for me, Im not sure which comes first, but any help would be much appreciated!   
Here is a brief background of my problem:   


Around 5 months ago I started having a host of GI symptoms, from on and off bloating, nausea and stomach cramps. The nausea is this weird phantom gaggy feeling in my throat, and has never actually resulted in me throwing up, but sure as hell feels like I will any moment. The constant feeling then turned into me getting spikes of anxiety - anytime my stomach feels weird, I feel anxious.   
I got myself checked by 2 gastroenterologists and did a host of tests (blood work, ultrasounds, CT scans, stool tests, fecal calprotectic tests etc.), that all came back clear, indicating that nothing was inherently medically wrong with my stomach.   
That being said, what I find challenging is that, sometimes I end up feeling nauseous and uncomfortable in the stomach, even though my mind is pretty clear, so I'm not able to establish a direct anxiety -&gt; stomach link. It's also worth mentioning that I've been on 5mg of escitalopram for 3 weeks, but still end up feeling anxious as hell in relation to my stomach symptoms.   


Now for the questions:   


1. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Terrible GI symptoms, especially with the constant nauseated feeling and stomach cramps, but all medical tests clear? 
2. Is there any such thing as ""subconscious anxiety""? I.E, could my stomach be acting up even when I'm not actively anxious in the moment? Does it have to do with being stressed out in the past? 
3. Has escitalopram helped anyone with these symptoms? 
4. How do I overcome this whole loop!?!

A doctor prescribed me with anxiety a few years ago but recently I've decided to delve a bit deeper into that diagnosis and my symptoms and from what I've read I deviate from a lot of stereotypical anxiety symptoms and am closer to ADHD symptoms in my opinion.

I recently had another doctor and I talked to them about ADHD, I feel they dismissed the possibility due to the already diagnosis of anxiety, it's not that I don't believe the doctors, I just want to inform myself as much as possible even if it means slogging thorough a big book, thanks :)",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10merav/hi_everyone_do_you_have_any_good_linksresearch_to/,Ultichi,

We collaborate and work together. Well, i‚Äôve worked with this young man and he just recently spoken out loud that I am following him when this is not the case.. 

This happened once class was released early. I leave class with one friend. I had to take a mini practice quiz. My female friend insists that I go out and sit at one of those tables out in the lobby area to take it. I don‚Äôt like sitting there. I cant concentrate on my work because many people go there and many people talk. I go to a study room to study solo in a room by my self. So she continues to insists and so i go with her.

Can this be caused by anxiety and does anyone else here experience this?",True,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was little and have had hallucinations since I was around 12. It takes me a few moments to realize I'm hallucinating if it's visual, if it's auditory I can usually tell right away. I was put into the mental hospital a couple years ago but lied that I didn't have hallucinations because I didn't want to be put on medication or have to stay at the mental hospital for longer.

In the past few months my hallucinations have gotten worse. I used to see small bugs, but now I see massive bugs like tarantulas and it scares the shit out of me because I'm really scared of bugs. I also see mice and started to very rarely see people inside my room. I hear music playing when there's nothing there, I also hear people talking but can't make out what they're saying, kind of like radio chatter or crowd noises. The other day I was going to get in the shower and saw a tarantula and it almost gave me a heart attack. Tarantulas don't even live in my country but I keep getting fooled by it.

Now I worry I'm just super paranoid because I constantly feel like I'm being watched. I swear I see people look at me through their windows while recording me and quickly duck away soon as I look at them. So every time I go on a walk, I am always checking out every house to make sure nobody is recording me. I'm in an apartment building and my window is next to the parking lot. Lately there's been multiple different cars (from people that don't live here) and they just park in front of my window with their lights on, it freaks me out really bad to the point where I duck and hide every time someone does it. Whenever someone is walking behind me, I will slow down or pretend to be checking my phone or tying my shoe because I have an intense feeling that they are going to kidnap me or stab me. When someone walks past me I will tense up and get ready to start sprinting in case they do something. I notice right away if someone is walking behind me, because when I walk I will repeatedly check behind me every 2 minutes or so, It's like compulsive and I don't realize how weird it looks until someone pointed it out.

I've started putting tape over the front cameras on my devices because I feel like someone is watching me through it. I stopped taking my medication because I couldn't afford it, and because I believe I am being poisoned to be dependent on medication. The only other sort of medication I take is birth control. And the only other mental illness I have besides anxiety is autism and suicidal ideation. 

Despite all this stuff, I can function well. I have great academic performance, I'm high honours and got a scholarship for college. I can do most things that normal people can do. The only thing I can't do is take public transport by myself, but I'm currently in the process of learning to do it.

I know all this stuff is unrealistic, why would anyone want to stalk me? Especially multiple people? I know it is very unlikely but that doesn't stop me from obsessing over it. Does anyone else always think stuff like this and see and hear things that aren't there?",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10mag67/experiencing_paranoia_and_hallucinations_for_a/,Gmaxincineroar,
10madfb,1674788515,Had a panic attack because of social media,True,"I wrote a post where I mentioned one of my past relationships and people started to say that I was abused for no real reason, since I just mentioned that I was 18 when I started dating my boyfriend, at the time 23. 

I'm still with him and we're now 23 and 27, we're happy together and he's honestly very sweet, but people called him ""groomer"" and said that I was a victim without even know me and that caused me a panic attack.

I deleted that post and I made the horrible mistake to write another, talking about the fact that I have some anger issues and I was sorry for some aggressive replies, but also to be careful about talking about someone's personal life like that, becauese it can trigger some people.

I also mentioned that I had to take Xanax to calm down after my first post, explaining that I was talking about it to bring an example to how much social medias can actually impact someone's life. 

Well... the results were people saying that I wasn't able to take criticism and that I was being rude, so I deserved that. Also, a lot of them were mocking me because I wrote a long post and someone tried to make it a copypasta.

I had to take a second dose of Xanax after that and I'm starting to slightly calm down just now. I just can't believe that people can be so trashy to mock someone who explained the importance of not being indelicate on social media and that socials can be very harmful.

I'm also 5 months on testosterone and it made my anger issues worse, I just can't control them and it's fucking horrible. 

I don't even know what exaclty I'm looking for with this post, just... I need some help",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10madfb/had_a_panic_attack_because_of_social_media/,TapAffectionate4912,

I have difficulty breathing through my nose and my mouth, When I breathe I often am wheezing. I also have some sort of clog in my throat where the right side of my throat feels locked up like there‚Äôs mucous trapped under my throat, but every time I try to cough to get it out I can never get it out and it is extremely uncomfortable. 24/7 I have these symptoms 

I went to an Otorhinolaryngologist and she did an x ray and found that I have a deviated septum to the left and that I have turbinate hypertrophy so she prescribed furonasal spray, flemoxin, and a pill to help with my symptoms. She said that this is normal and my symptoms will surely go away. I did the treatment like she said, this didn‚Äôt help with my symptoms at all.

Then I went to a Psychiatrist she told me that this is most likely anxiety. Prescribed me Aprexia, and referred me to a Pneumonologist. I also took the medication like she told me and didn‚Äôt feel better at all

Finally I went to the Pneumonologist and he wanted two tests done a pft and an x ray of the lungs he also prescribed me Neufil, Broncopulmin, and Prinosi. I‚Äôve taken the medication up to this point and still feel no better. When he saw the x ray he said my lungs are perfectly fine prescribed me an inhaler and says if he doesn‚Äôt find anything with the pft test that I should see a psychiatrist

10mab32,1674788339,"I need to face my anxiety, but how can I do so?",True,"My anxiety is slowly destroying my life by ruining everything that I like and turning every feeling into a bad vibe. There are not really events that make me anxious and I don‚Äôt avoid situations. It‚Äôs rather that whatever I do, I‚Äôll feel the pain and impending doom. I‚Äòm so sick of it, but also highly motivated to change it.
In therapy I always felt like this can‚Äòt be it. The exercises didn‚Äòt seem to fit to my actual issues. Also there was no progress to be made in my day to day life as I didn‚Äòt act on my anxiety in the first place, but I still felt awful from it.
There is just that feeling that I have for some months if not years now, that my anxiety wants me to face it. It‚Äòs like an instict that‚Äôs telling me to let it go finally. In my clearest moments this is the conclusion I always come to. I need to try it at least.
But how could I do so? I remember when I was young how fear was just an emotion. Nowadays it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt really fear anything anymore, but I‚Äòm kind of anxious all the time. I believe if I really want to face my anxiety I need it go way beyond the baseline anxiety in which I‚Äòm stuck at. So my question would be how I can I let it go and let my anxiety do it‚Äôs thing?

I have this issue where when I find a person or a friend I try to do everything in my capacity to make sure they stay. Which sounds psychotic but hear me out. I mostly do this by acts of service, spending quality time, giving gifts, and just talking whenever I can, but it gets to a point where when they don't talk as much or change their normal way of talking to me it's like all the alarms go off in my head and I try even harder, this is the part where friendships just end. I say stuff like being around you makes me feel happy and safe and I start to open up about why I act the way I do from past trauma which is essentially trauma dumping. The friends I make then feel like they owe me their company or worry I'm going to go off the deep end. I don't want to be that kind of burden to anyone, I want to be a good person but I'm also so scared of people leaving that it gives me anxiety attacks. I get scared when people left me on read, and it just feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy when eventually they leave.

Flying
Tornadoes
Hypochondria 
Traveling

To celebrate my anniversary with my beloved partner this week, we took a trip to a destination we‚Äôve been dreaming of for a long time.

I:
Flew (1.5 hour flights so not so bad, actually enjoyed not being in control for the most part, easy flights)
Got sick (but not that sick, still amazed I was able to be cool about it, we took it pretty easy)
Lived through a tornado warned storm (thankfully I have lots of radar apps and knew we were probably fine. Turned out to be a nothing burger and I could‚Äôve just had no anxiety if I didn‚Äôt know what was going on but I did)

When we landed back home I wanted to spike something and yell look at me! I did it! Living with anxiety is so weird. I had some hard days on vacation but was able to get right by the evening each day.

Now I have congestion in lungs but am testing negative for covid, it doesn‚Äôt feel that bad, I just hate being sick. And now there‚Äôs a covid outbreak at work, but I haven‚Äôt been back to work yet so all should be fine, that anxiety is just creeping back in.

10m80yr,1674781571,I Have Anxiety,True,"Hey everyone, today I am going to be sharing with you a little more about myself and my anxiety. I have had anxiety for quite a while now and I want to continue keeping my videos personal and covering deep details that aren't talked about enough regarding mental health.

If you resonate with what I talk about here please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel for videos about topics like this.

Let‚Äôs start off with the basics. What type of anxiety do I have? Am I diagnosed? How long have I been struggling with it? 

So, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or G.A.D. for short. Yes, I was diagnosed by my doctor and I have been struggling with this mental health disorder for almost 8 years now. It really started to affect my daily life after I experienced my first panic attack back in Grade 11. I made a video about that day which I will link in this video.

Essentially, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is the aspect of anxiety‚Äìworrying intensely about uncertainties in the future‚Äìcombined with the breadth of its reach, touching all aspects of life that someone without G.A.D. would not view as worrisome, hence the ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù part of the name.

The Anxiety and Depression Association of America says, ‚ÄúGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry. They may worry more than seems warranted about actual events or may expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern.‚Äù

That really hits the nail on the head; my anxiety is exactly that, worrying about general things in life. I have anxiety towards eating, traveling, socialization, safety, being alone, world-ending events, horror movies, people getting sick, and so much more. 

As simple as this sounds, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is just like any other anxiety disorder with the exception of what areas in life it affects. Someone with Social Anxiety Disorder may only get extremely anxious specifically towards social settings whereas I do fine in a lot of social situations but a lot of generic things in life can cause me severe anxiety. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail about G.A.D. specifically because that requires its own video which I plan to do in the near future.

Now, one thing I would be wondering at this point if I were watching this 8 years ago when I was just learning about anxiety, what it all meant, and the fact that I was experiencing it everyday, is whether I‚Äôm ashamed of it or not. Am I embarrassed by it? Does it affect my self-esteem?

And my answer to that varies; if you were to ask me whether I was ashamed and embarrassed because of my anxiety 6 years ago, the answer would have absolutely been ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I‚Äôve been learning about anxiety and mental health constantly over the past 8 years and during the first few years I was experiencing it was when I had the largest amount of new information coming at me from all directions.

I was very much in the dark, I didn‚Äôt know what panic attacks were, I didn‚Äôt understand anxiety, I thought meditation was weird, and I didn‚Äôt know a lot about anxiety disorders. All I knew was that I couldn‚Äôt stay in my physics classroom but I was alright in the other ones, I couldn‚Äôt eat in public anymore, getting a ride home from anyone except my parents made me extremely anxious, and there were so many social situations like field trips, sports, and parties that I had to pass up all because of this thing inside my head that I didn‚Äôt understand and couldn‚Äôt control.

It made me extremely embarrassed. I was constantly making up excuses for why I couldn‚Äôt do something in order to avoid telling people it was because of my anxiety. And when I wasn‚Äôt telling people excuses I was brainstorming constantly to come up with semi-believable new ones.

I was quietly ashamed of myself and had low self-esteem because at the end of the day I knew that I was the one doing this to myself, or so I thought. While it is technically true that it was my own brain causing these issues, I took that to heart and was ignoring or ignorant to the fact that I had a disorder that was causing me to lose control of the situation.

So I blamed myself when I couldn‚Äôt go on a school trip or go out to a restaurant with friends. I just saw it as my own mind being stupid and useless, and I would think of myself as pathetic. It‚Äôs a very easy and slippery slope to fall down when going through any struggles with our mental health.

However, if you were to ask me those same questions today I would have a completely different answer. I have completely turned around my entire view on my life and who I am with this disorder. I take pride in who I am and I use it as a tool to connect with others and provide help where I can rather than letting it eat away at my self-esteem.

Are there times when I have a panic attack or my anxiety stops me from doing a simple task one day and I just feel stupid and beat myself up? Yes, we all have those moments of frustration when our emotions are running hot. But do I feel that way for weeks or months? No. I pick myself back up and keep working on improving my mental health.

I‚Äôve learned so much about my anxiety, how my mind functions, and mental health in general. I‚Äôve gained new insight about life like how utterly vital our mindset is at any given moment in life and that, as Randy Pausch brilliantly stated, ‚Äúwe cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.‚Äù

So now I use the experience and time I‚Äôve gained with my mental health struggles and success in life to provide some insight and connection with people who are in the same position I was when I was first experiencing anxiety, very confused and scared. As well as people who are more experienced with it like I am. 

I see it as an integral part of my character and one of the largest factors that made me who I have become and who I continue to grow into. Honestly, as much pain and suffering I have been through and continue to experience, I would never erase it from my life if given the chance.

That‚Äôs a little bit about me and my anxiety. This, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg and I will be sharing plenty more of my experiences on my YouTube Channel which can be found in my bio.

 This is probably going to be a bit ranty, but I'm still in shock by the whole situation.

 Tonight I was at Gigaboks in Bergen, Norway.
When I stood in line.  A guy slipped in right before me.  Blank in his eyes, and he had already tried to pay before the customer in front of me had finished as well.  I saw that the cashier also found it uncomfortable, so I said that there is a queue here!  Answers me with a blank look, looks behind him, and probably nods something that can only be taken as a yes.  So I now came forward and pay for my stuff.  While I'm paying, he pulls out the airpod I had in my right ear that I usually have when I'm on the move, and I think.  Oh well?  Do we have a problem here and he asks straight out what the problem is?  Blank stare, says something to me in Russian or Ukrainian.  And I understand that the guy probably doesn't understand a single word of Norwegian.  Ask again ""What's the problem?""  nothing.  Get paid and realize that this is nothing to get involved in, and get off.  While I'm packing the bag, he catches up with me.  Starts talking to me in one of the above languages, tries to kick my feet and then SPITS RIGHT IN MY FACE!!!
The adrenaline rushes in and I grab the guy, shouting What the hell are you doing?!?  Im going to call the police!  People crowd around and just watch.  No help.  The guy is terrified and shouts HELP HELP!!!  I hold him for a minute, two max until I release him before this gets too bad.  The person runs away and the guards arrive 1-2 minutes later.  We can't find him.  Im just shooked by the whole situation.  It‚Äôs reported to the police, I will receive the video recording tomorrow for the report.  This is the strangest day I've had and am still completely in shock. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

If anyone witnessed this. Feel free to get in touch. 

 Tldr;  experienced a true /r/publicfreakout by someone sneaking in the queue.

10m6qdl,1674777939,I‚Äôve been offered a potentially life changing job and I‚Äôm terrified to take the risk,True,"I‚Äôve been running my own dog walking business for 12 years and basically I‚Äôm exhausted. I live in England so work outdoors in all weathers. I‚Äôve got back, knee, and shoulder injuries from dogs pulling constantly. I don‚Äôt get paid holiday/any time off and I don‚Äôt have a pension or any plan for the future. I‚Äôve got enough saved for a house deposit but can‚Äôt get a mortgage because my income is so sporadic.

I‚Äôve been looking into other options for a while now. Been looking at other self employed jobs I could do but also going back to being an employee.

A friends just messaged to say they think they can get me a job at their company. Starting off just packing boxes but there‚Äôs a testing job coming up as well. Starting pay is about ¬£3k more a year then I currently earn and would be consistent and if I get the testing job the pay jumps. I‚Äôd get paid holiday, every weekend off, pension contributions etc. I could also potentially (if the company agrees) keep doing cat feeds in the evenings for a bit of extra cash.

In theory it‚Äôs great. Consistent cash, lots of benefits, and I can give my body time to heal. I can use my spare time to work on my hobbies instead of panicking over tax returns or customer emails.

But I‚Äôm terrified. I haven‚Äôt been an employee since I worked a temp office job during university. What if I have a nightmare boss. What if I hate the job. Will I be able to get up at 7am every weekday and go to work for 8 hours straight. What if I bomb the interview.

I‚Äôm autistic and can get reasonable accommodations for that. My friend says once I‚Äôm trained I can just put my headphones in and crack on every day.

I suppose worst case scenario if I hate it at least it‚Äôll be income for a year or so while I figure out what to do instead.

10m68lr,1674776587,Dear Fellow Redditors,True,"This is going to be long , but my mind is fucking heavy right now. No one may read this but it‚Äôll be good to type out. 

Back in late August of 2021, i posted out on this sub about reaching out to an old childhood friend that I haven‚Äôt spoken to since July 2019. I was nervous, and although it had been 2 1/2 years, I didn‚Äôt want to feel or seem weird or invasive. Fast forward to October 1 2021, I finally reached out to her. 

I waited a week with no reply, until I finally got one on October 7, 2021. Shit went perfect, we immediately clicked like we never even took a break. Texted for a while and then had a 9 hour phone call catching up on life. 

Now this is someone I literally talked to pretty much daily ever since 2010. We met on left 4 dead when we were 12 years old and always had that right bond that could never be broken.although I live in california and she lives in texas, we had a few long distance relationships. Back in high school we had our first official one but ended up splitting due to distance. And that was fine. We still kept in contact and had the same bond we‚Äôve always had despite the breakup. 

Over the span of late 2021 up until about 2 weeks ago everything was perfect. Sure we had our moments where we got into it and didn‚Äôt talk for a few days to a week, but that was super rare. We never really argued or anything of that matter. 

We dated officially from late October of 2021 up until mid August of 2022. During that time everything was literally perfect. I had plans on going out there multiple times, but each time ended up getting canceled due to things going on there or her anxiety. Which kinda hurt me, but I understood. We‚Äôve always had that clingy type of friendship, even past august of 2022 we were still like that. Still regularly told each other I love you and shit like that. Still got each other stuff and always helped each other out. I sent her a lot of stuff between November and December and she was truthfully so thankful and happy for all of it. In January 2023 I got her a little memorial for her dog that passed and I could tell she truly loved it and cherishes it. 

January 18, 2023 was our last ‚Äúofficial good‚Äù day. We played disney together like we always did and I thought everything was fine. I sensed a little mood change that day and the precious day but never thought anything of it. I thought maybe it was just my double texting that set her off. So I gave her a week of silence. 

I reached out yesterday, the 25th of January because I felt like we were slowly fading. She said she was gonna be honest and that we‚Äôre have faded. And that shit killed me. She went on to say that she would never intend to hurt me ( which is true ) and that she‚Äôs never want to make me sad or cry, which is also true. But of course I‚Äôm going to be. She went on to tell me she had a new boyfriend. That shit crushed me. I kept my loyalty and never ever spoke to another female even AFTER we broke up, thinking maybe we‚Äôll get back together. Knowing my heart is stuck with one person. NEVER thinking shit like this would happen again. The thought of being with someone else or even looking at a new relationship doesn‚Äôt even phase me. I can‚Äôt bring myself to it ever. I just don‚Äôt understand how or why this shit always happens to me. 

Although she has a new boyfriend, and is confused about us now, I know for a fact that we‚Äôre both there for each other no matter what. That shit will never be thrown away, no matter what‚Äôs said or done between us. It just kills me to know that for the 2nd time we‚Äôre fading away again. After we had everything planned out.

I was just prescribed Lexapro yesterday for anxiety and started my first 10mg dose this morning.

About an hour in I started to notice a slight headache that became a very noticeable light headedness, shakiness, slight nausea and heightened anxiety (more than my previous baseline). It‚Äôs now been a little over 2.5 hours since I took the medication and the side affects have become so bad that I had to clear my entire schedule of meetings for the rest of the day.

I‚Äôve read that first day affects are common and can persist for the first few weeks as your body adjusts. Is it normal to have this strong of side affects so suddenly after taking a first dose? Should I consider starting with a half dose or taking the medication in the evening? It‚Äôs a particularly busy time at work right now so I need to be able to at least function and get through the day while my body adjusts to the drug.

Does the fact I suddenly started getting them mean something must have happened to my heart? Or could it be a whole host of causes?

I have these symptoms that I don‚Äôt like anything touching my skin or me touching anything. It‚Äôs so awful and I can‚Äôt seem to find any information on it. The most I can find is tactile sensitivity but I do see it‚Äôs mainly seen in children.

I don‚Äôt know why this feeling won‚Äôt go away and it started to progress in late 2021 and it‚Äôs gotten so bad, like it‚Äôs constant. I don‚Äôt like wearing backpacks or having a purse anymore. I don‚Äôt like how it feels, I don‚Äôt like the feeling of the fabric of my blanket. I always wear long pants or jackets to cover up my skin. Like for example this morning I‚Äôm just trying to play video games and I don‚Äôt like how my legs are touching the bed or my legs rubbing together. When I lay down I feel like I can‚Äôt focus what I‚Äôm watching because the blanket ‚Äúfeels weird‚Äù and then I feel restless and my mind races and I get so scared. 

The rain or wind hitting my skin can make me panic, I absolutely hate when things touch my hands. Sometimes when I touch things it just don‚Äôt feel real. I don‚Äôt know, I just feel crazy. It‚Äôs so scary, I scared I‚Äôm losing touch with reality. I just feel like I want to drop something I‚Äôm holding or I notice I feel bad when I play video games I don‚Äôt want to hold the controller. I don‚Äôt like to write because the pen ‚Äúfeels strange‚Äù. It‚Äôs horrible, and it causes me to panic. 

I will say I noticed this symptoms when I had panic attacks and I haven‚Äôt had a bad panic attack in a while. But I feel since I felt that way in a scary situation it‚Äôs constantly on my mind now. It‚Äôs ruining my quality of life as we all use our hands and feel things every day. I mentioned it to my therapist and she doesn‚Äôt know what it could be. I miss having a purse and just doing basic fucking tasks. I feel so hopeless and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm losing my mind. It‚Äôs obviously not normal. I hope you guys may know what I‚Äôm talking about or understand. Even typing or texting with my fingers feel so bad and it causes me to avoid doing basic things. Like I don‚Äôt like how the seat belt feels and something as simple as that makes me feel so bad I could possibly panic. There‚Äôs times I just want to possibly end it because it‚Äôs so awful. I want it to go away because if I didn‚Äôt feel this way I would be able to enjoy life much more. I don‚Äôt understand why my brain is like this. 

A bit of backstory and my background. I am seeing a therapist, currently not on any medications and I haven‚Äôt in my life. I do know I‚Äôm suffering from PTSD, long history of trauma and anxiety, depression, had have panic attacks. I can‚Äôt tolerate stressful situations. I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream like state and things don‚Äôt feel real most of the time. Going to work and driving have been difficult and these days I‚Äôm mainly coped up in my room and I feel so socially awkward I just isolate. I‚Äôm really considering on seeing a psychiatrist and hopefully seeing what the hell is wrong with me. People may think I‚Äôm on the spectrum, I feel like it could be OCD or ADHD. Or who knows I may be crazy. I‚Äôm just so scared. 

If you made it this far thank you, I don‚Äôt post much and especially about something so sensitive. I don‚Äôt talk about my mental problems with anyone other than my boyfriend and my therapist. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anyone and I hope anyone could give me advice or some support.

I'm just a bit anxious about the whole aftermath with the vaccine protests and such. Is it really something to worry about? Obviously time is the real doctor here, but should I be afraid of any long-term effects by Johnson? Maybe risk of ADE (antibody-dependent-enhancement), blood clot or heart diseases? And maybe a bit of a dumb question, but how long does the vaccine stay in your body for?

And since I heard Johnson &amp; Johnson is something used for the long run, can I be feeling side effects still like say 5 years down the road? As a citizen of the world I am just curious what is happening inside my body. I don't wanna read too much conspiracy theories as that is driving me crazy but I don't wanna read the constantly controlled government based articles like WHO or Johnson &amp; Johnson itself neither. There is a lot of political things involved and obviously they won't tell every little thing.

Just again, I was even considering talking to a doctor about this. I feel naturally concerned for my health and such things. That's why I decided to first post my questions here. Hopefully they will be answered and it can give me some comfort. Once again, sorry for the long read. Thanks in advance!",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10m0qr8/vaccination_concerns/,BLResnick,

10m0l5h,1674762344,I don't know what to do with my growing anxiety. It's ruining my life.,True,"Brief backstory- I had an abusive childhood, constantly made to doubt myself and others, I have trust issues and very bad anxiety attacks that come from out of nowhere. I have a lot of trauma that won't seems to leave me and health issues that have been left unchecked. I have never been able to get help because my household was neglectful, then now that I finally made it out of that abusive situation I have no job, very little money and living with my bf and his family. They are very supportive but I am a lot of work...

 My anxiety has gotten so bad that I'm in a constant state of disassociation and on the edge of panic. It is debilitating. I can't concentrate on anything, I have insomnia, I can't have proper conversations...I am so needy for reassurance and my trust issues are putting me at a distance from my partner. I have tried to distract myself, I've tried meditation, but I get horrible headaches and can't focus hard enough on anything to successfully do it. I can't get to a therapist because it's too expensive and I can't seem to get hired anywhere to fix that problem. I have no hobbies, no friends, nothing anymore. I also had a car accident recently that seems to have made things worse on top of everything. I compare myself to everyone my age and am so behind because of this. I don't know what I can do to calm my ass down and be brought out of this and I need to fix this before I ruin my relationship and myself. I just need relief. I hate the shadow of a person I have become.

please, any advice or programs would really be helpful. I am so desperate for a solution.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10m0l5h/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_growing_anxiety/,Buffalosauceplease,
10lzytz,1674760789,ima be alone forever bruh,True,"All my friends I've been super super close with for years are getting into relationships, a few are within the main friend group. Every time this happens it naturally just means they spend more time with that other person and now hearing about the newest relationship happening im worried I'm finally left with no one person to talk to and do things with.

My options in the group were extremely limited and now nonexistent but I won't be attending college in person until the fall and I don't have a good way to meet anyone. And I didn't mind not having a relationship until all my closest friends now have one and I can almost never talk to them 1 on 1 cause they're constantly with their s/o. One of them is my favorite person in this world to talk to but I never liked them in a relationship kinda way cause I had always known they were gay and knew it wasn't possible, turns out that's not the case now but they found someone better already.

I'm happy for all of them but it's making me want to hurt myself again and go away for good cause I mentally can't handle it and I keep convincing myself they're better off if the odd one out stops bothering them. I'm pretty introverted and missed out on a lot of social things in high school so I think my personality is too empty for someone to ever like me in that way. Actually good genuine people deserve better.

I just started new classes for college and I have a job so I'm just having a hard time dealing with the fear of partially losing my favorite people on top of that other stuff. It feels completely pointless now. It feels like they'd be better off without me bothering them and I'd be better off not being around to mentally suffer. I'm not achieving anything either.

There even sometimes comes a point of confidence and like even, maybe this could be fun. Then out of nowhere anxiety comes out again. ""Plane is going to crash,"" ""I'm going to be 30,000+ feet in the air with nothing underneath,"" ""the situation is completely out of my control,"" ""what if I become claustrophobic,"" ""what if I have a panic attack on the plane""
What if, what if, what if?? 

I will be bringing plenty of distractions, I'm not going to get drunk (8am flight). The flight is from Denver CO to LAX, so it's approximately a 2 - 2 1/2 hour flight.

 *Social anxiety = Excessively cautious = Overly careful with doing the perfect thing to get a perfect result = Too much concern for possible failure / rejection / pain / problems / negative experiences.*  


*All this negative thinking is a way for you to maintain control. You believe that you can think your way out of ever experiencing negative things in life. You believe that you can predict what's going to happen so that you can prepare yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally to handle all the uncertainties of life and not feel as much pain. If something bad does happen, you maintain control by saying ""see, I knew this would happen"" and you reinforce your habit of overthinking because you think it's actually helping you.*  


*Fantasizing about other people = It's a manifestation of your insecurities. You don't believe that you can actually have a real experience with that person. So instead of actually trying something in reality, you escape into a fantasy world where you have complete control of what happens. Same thing with porn. Reality has possibilities of both positive and negative experiences. Porn is a way to escape into a world where you get the positive without taking any risks of pain, problems, and negative experiences. That's why porn / fantasizing is so addictive, but eventually people realize that it's empty, depressing, and they want something real.*  


*So it all boils down to you being afraid of uncertainty and you cope with it by trying to maintain control with your excessive thinking / fantasizing.*  


*Not everything works out in life. Not everyone will be interested in you. Life can be unideal / awkward / difficult / uncertain / uncomfortable / chaotic. It can be full of rejection, mistakes, failure, and negative experiences. You can't control life. Unless you do or say very little. Unless you hide yourself from the world. Unless you limit your existence and participation in this world to the point where you're not living very much at all.*  


*The more you escape reality the harder it will be for you to learn how to thrive in reality. You get better at escapism while your problems in reality become bigger and bigger to the point where you never want to face it. What's comfortable now (escapism / porn / fantasizing) becomes uncomfortable later on (unable to function or socialize). What's uncomfortable now (learning to face things that doesn't go your way) becomes comfortable later on (freedom from the prison of your own mind + having real experiences with real people).*  


*You have to learn to let go of control. Because you really aren't in control of much. You can die at any moment. Your health / finances / materialism / relationships can all go away in an instant. Accidents / crime / diseases / change happens. You don't control anything. You control less by overthinking than you would if you just let go of control.*",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10lz4t3/overthinkers_please_read_this/,4to20milliamps,

This all leads to the content of this post, where I am; an update:

---

**TLDR:** After trying a number of medications, I seem to have found that are starting to give me some hope that I might be able to change course with regards to my anxiety, lack of focus, and (in my internal view) failure at life.

---

**Full Post:**

I have actually recently had a bit of a breakthrough with anxiety, though from reading online it's sure to be short lived if I don't find a long term medication and or solution.

Currently, I've been prescribed a few things from my Psychiatrist, not all at the same time (I got the first 2 before the third one).

First is Clonazepam, which is a Benzodiazepine. It's been great because basically from day one I noticed my anxiety in my work meetings reduce significantly. Over time it's seemed to get even better. Of course as a Benzodiazepine the big worry is that it doesn't take long for tolerance to build up, and the withdrawal symptoms seem terrifying on paper, so Ideally I think the hope is that the next medication on the list that takes longer to start working solves the issue for the long term so I can come off of the Clonazepam sooner rather than later, especially because its a schedule IV drug, which while legal because its been prescribed by a doctor to me for treatment of illness, still feels risky given you can get into trouble if someone else takes some off you etc etc. That being said, its effect started off mild and then became almost magical. Today after a scrum meeting I didnt go to lie down for half an hour. I needed no time to recover. I started back working basically right away. Before this, I had gotten to the point where I would say my piece and then lie down under my bed because hearing other people talk about their accomplishments from the previous day would make my anxiety more severe and this little dose of Clonazepam seems to have been enough to eliminate that. Its crazy.

I still have some anxiety, serious anxiety even, but I don't feel like suddenly quitting my job anymore.

The second drug is Escitalopram. This is a pretty typical SSRI, and since I've only been on it for a week, I can't say too much. At least in the 1 week I've been on it though, I haven't yet had a complete loss of function in my penis. I still seem able to get off, while my erection isn't as hard as it typically is, it's still functional, and while it feels a little bit desensitized (which is a bit of a problem for me because I've always been on the longer side of time to finish). Another side effect it has had is pretty extreme insomnia, where I've been having a hard time falling asleep, only to wake up again not long after getting around 2-3 hours of sleep the past few days. I've been advised to perhaps have it in the morning instead and so I'll see if that works. I think it so far, it has been bearable otherwise. I really hope it works to help with some of the OCD tendencies I've started to build up I assume due to the anxiety. I also hope it works for the anxiety, but I'll have to wait a few more weeks to really see if it's helping. Hopefully it helps the depression too.

The last drug is probably going to be the biggest, and that's Adderall XR. I actually held off for a few weeks even though my Psychiatrist offered it earlier because I was so afraid of the side effects, addiction, tolerance problems etc, but thus far, on my very meager dosage, it seems just fine. I actually don't notice much with the 10mg he started me off on (he wanted to start at 20, but I was afraid so we started low). I notice no heart rate increase, no headache, no notable mood changes (maybe slightly less depressed and gloomy but that's probably the anxiety), no dizziness or headache, and only a little bit of appetite loss, but I'm a big guy so that's actually a really positive benefit. I out of curiosity after having had it for a few days and noticing nothing decided to double up my dosage to the 20 he had wanted to put me on before, and I can say it seems to already have started to work. I imagine I could still use a higher dosage still as the effect is very mild and I still have many issues, but I feel like I'm seeing real effects already with my ability to stay on task. I'm clearly not there yet, but I'm starting to be confident that this might be a great long term solution for me given that serious tolerance issues appear to usually take years to build up.

I still haven't been diagnosed with anything, which worries me because I fear that if I for some reason lose connection with them, I'll need to start the process all over and have an abrupt stoppage, but at least right now its looking good.

Maybe the Clonazepam saved me from the side effects, maybe its just really compatible with me, or maybe its the light dosage, but it seems fine so far and I only have hopes it'll get even better. The psychiatrist has suggested I see them every 2 weeks to increase the dosage until I hit 50mg, or start running into side effects I can't manage.

I'm currently shopping around looking for a psychologist to hopefully accompany my medication as well and help me with both my anxiety, avoidance (nearly agoraphobia), social issues likely partially caused by that etc. Im looking at various profiles on different websites to try to figure out who I should contact first. I've had some bad experiences in the past with psychologists so I'm pretty hesitant and picky.

* I've had a psychologist who seemed nice but due to government program restrictions I could only see 6 times, which was useless.

* I've had a psychologist who told me I was ""a completely fucked up human being"", which had me in tears and a deeeeeeeeep depression for weeks (I think she thought that was tough love or some nonsense, but it was really unprofessional and damaging and in hindsight I should have reported her).

* I've had a psychologist who I didnt last long with just because their buildings smelled awful, and like it had mold, the place looked like a mess and their furniture was old and ripped apart.

* I've even had a psychologist who tried to push religion on me, which was not cool at all and I noped right out of that situation.

It's really hard to know what you are going to get, and when I know my insurance will (I believe) only cover the first 1000 bucks per year, leaving me to probably pay thousands for this, it's a hard pill to swallow given how much I expect to have to shop around.

I'm still going to try it again though, and maybe my being more picky this time will pay off. I think ultimately if I find one that works, even if I have to spend 10,000 dollars to fix my issues it'll be worth it.

A few months ago my prognosis on life was dim. Like one bad event or bad enough day from being over dim.

Right now, Its still dim, dark even, but I at least see a potential path to success (fulfillment and happiness) again. The destination still looks extremely far away, like years away even, but at least I see it; A chance to fix my life so that I can maybe enjoy the last 2/3rds even if the first 1/3rd has been horrible.

I was still keeping anxiety at bay and functioning normally and was overall a happier person, but then something traumatic happened. I got into a car crash, lost my first car ever, and severely broke my wrist. Although I am healing well, I feel like I am back to square one with this anxiety.

Every day I wake up and worry about all the ways I could die and if I will. I‚Äôm starting to check my heart rate and O2 more often and I had stopped doing that for years. Starting to consult Dr. Google for every little thing again, and stepping into a car just as a passenger is like stepping onto a battlefield meanwhile before this happened being in a car and even driving one was like walking to me.

I am so incredibly heartbroken. I finally felt like I had overcome this and here I am having to fight again. I had to stop working so I have no money and basically no purpose. I am supposed to be working on a certification program to be able to get a job with my degree, but I have no motivation to participate anymore. Eating is becoming more and more infrequent. I used to love to drive, go out to eat, or just hang out anywhere and now those things I loved I now dread so I just stay in my room and play the sims 4 basically the entire day because again, it is a nice escape. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Everyday I wake up and just wish I could just go back to sleep and continue sleeping whole day letting it pass me by because it‚Äôs the only time I don‚Äôt have to deal with anxiety. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm supposed to just live like this. I have a therapist but I don‚Äôt know how much she is really helping me. I feel like I just get the typical advice: breathe, challenge negative thoughts, and distract yourself.

10lxups,1674755498,I don't know if I should move back home or not,True,"Hi everyone,

I (21F) moved into my first apartment this fall to be closer to my university after being at home during community college for two years. I am currently attending my dream school, which happens to be 25 minutes from my parent's home, and it has been a huge disappointment. I live alone and all of my classes during the fall semester were online, now 2 out of 5 of my classes are online this semester, which was not by my choice. Making friends has been so difficult as a transfer student and having mostly online classes no matter how hard I try. Additionally, I live in a city which I learned I do not cope well in. The noise, the crime, and the traffic make me so anxious. I have panic attacks constantly whether that be in class or at my apartment. I feel lonely, depressed, and anxious 24/7 (I am on meds &amp; in therapy). My parents support me whether I move back home and commute or stay at my apartment. I know that moving back home and commuting to class would ease my anxiety and my feelings of loneliness, however, I feel that if I move home I will be missing out on the ""college experience."" I am at a loss for what to do, so any insight is appreciated.

A few months ago, I moved to a new school in a completely different place. I haven't been able to make a single friend over here, and everything is so difficult because I am really lonely.

Today, in one of my classes, the teacher said that we have to speak to the whole class about our ideas on a certain topic we're doing. It was completely unexpected, and I honestly stopped functioning. 

There aren't even that many students in that class, only around 11-12. But I just got so anxious, I was shaking all over and I couldn't control it, I couldn't focus on what anyone was saying as they presented. I think the teacher had noticed that something was wrong. She quietly came over to me and said that I don't have to speak in front of the class. Which sounded very relieving, but I then felt so guilty because it felt like I was getting special treatment, even though I know it's technically not.

AND THEN I just started crying in the corner where I sit, so I excused myself and ran to the restroom. It was so sudden, I was literally sobbing, and kept unintentionally making weird squeaky sounds when crying üò≠ which sounds a bit funny but during that time it was the worst. I think everyone saw me crying and I feel so embarrassed, like a stupid child.

I overdosed on edibles in June of 2021
My body went through absolute hell (anxiety, panic attacks &amp; dizzy spells) before I could see my physician 2 months later. He put me on Xanax 2mg a day- started to feel better weeks later but still not 100%. Was referred to a psychiatrist in the spring of 2022. From the beginning- because I went back &amp; forth to the ER &amp; Urgent care for panic attacks(don‚Äôt waste your time) I was given Hydroxyzine and propranolol‚Ä¶ nothing worked and it actually made me feel worse. My psychiatrist gave me Sertraline. I took it for 6 months- gained hella weight and it stopped working. Panic attacks came back with full force. 
Stopped taking them in July 2022. 
Felt fine and had tapered down to .50 mg of Xanax by that time. 

Christmas 2022- I contracted a stomach virus or food poisoning and was sick for a week- vomiting, cramping etc. 
As soon as I started to feel better I was back to square one. My psychiatrist put me on fluoxetine(Prozac) by day 9 my body went nuts on me- shaking and anxiety so bad that I had to stop taking them. It was the scariest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. Actually by day 7 I felt weird but didn‚Äôt want to give up until I was forced to. 

My psychiatrist nurse asked me what meds did I want next- ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING me????!!! WHAT A JOKE TO ASK A PATIENT- as if I‚Äôm supposed to know and I still have yet to hear back from them! Sad 

Today is day 6 of dealing with tension headaches and it sucks really bad along with the anxiety. Monday I took an excedrine for tension headaches only and didn‚Äôt realize it had caffeine in it and I had the worst panic attack since this all started with me. Btw, can‚Äôt have caffeine or MSG bc the edible gave me food intolerances. Currently I‚Äôm feeling a little better. 

I have high anxiety, mild insomnia, body tremors, restless legs, dizziness and tension headaches. 

Could this be antidepressant withdrawal? 

FYI I‚Äôm scared of all these meds and would like to start healing naturally‚Ä¶

Just had this random thought one night about how bad it would be if I didn't sleep well any more.  So I started worrying that I would lose my house, job, family.....just everything.

I know this is a mental issue for me.

I know its a lot to ask for people to read that, then this, but if you have a spare 5 mins, I'd be really grateful.

I'm here again to ask if anyone else has ever felt like I described in my original post? I still don't feel like I've ever understood how I'm feeling. The thoughts are just as strong now as they were 5 years ago, but now instead of a uni student, I'm an adult living in a city where I need to travel on the underground &amp; buses etc a lot, and having these thoughts in those situations is really starting to destroy me.

I just don't feel like a functional human. I can't even hold a conversation with colleagues face to face without using half my brain to focus hard on managing these intrusive feelings. I've started the process of therapy as thankfully my job provides good health care cover. But I've been down that road before (see original post) and it didn't bring me much relief.

So yeah, anyone else that gets these sorts of feelings? I'd love nothing more than to have someone who understands how I'm feeling to chat to.

I suddenly had a strange tight feeling around my head which after the situation I belive was a tension Headache,, freaked me out and made my anxiety soar. He noticed that my eyes glazed over and I was staring. I was trying to understand in that moment what was happening and didn't know what was going on with me. I have anxiety and sever depression.

 I ask him to hold me please that I just needed him to hold me. The only thing he did was sit next to me and kept asking me what's wrong, I tried my best to explain, saying everything feels weird, its like tight,  I don't know what's wrong was the first thing I said. Repeatedly being asked what's wrong when I just need a hug to calm down I snapped at him and raised my voice. He proceed to ""give me what I wanted"" and laid down and flopped his arm out ""letting you lay on me"" without actually being comforted. He feels like that was a good enough comfort.

In my mind it made me more anxious feeling like now I'm just a big problem, I'm ruining everything now, I still feel awful what's happening. I continued downstairs to our room and took my anxiety meds and cried and started trying to calm myself down, breathing hard and trying to breathe and he asks me again what's wrong and I'm just trying to calm down still so being irritable right in that moment I snapped at him again saying I don't know and now he's upset with me.

After a bit we talked and I tried explaining to him what I needed and what was happening. I ended up saying I don't know why I keep trying to go to you for comfort you never help me. Which he dosent he gets upset at me and says fuck you and walks off. I just continue to cry and feel overwhelmed and exhuasted from my anxiety. He comes back trying to talk again and I try to explain again.

He tells me he didn't have the space to give me a hug he needs to set his boundaries,  he dosent understand it. ""Does that nullify everything I've done for you?!"" He says. I don't understand why this situation takes back everything he's done, I'm very grateful to him though and do appreciate him. He thinks I just need to try these things that these girls on a YouTube or podcast that he listens to on, Bobby Lee's show I think, where it works well for them! Like go splash water on your face , breathe, use grounding techniques. And I try to! I try breathing but he's right there next to me and I'm able to have someone hold me and that helps so much better and capms me down real fast. But because he didn't have the space and he feels like he's overextended himself to me and I can't just do the things he says. It's always what I need , I need this and that.
I feel defeated. He told me I'm crying wolf. And then later he said this hasn't happened before usually it's triggered by when we argue or something. Which that's not the trigger, arguing with him dosent cause the anxiety to happen, it dosent help either though. I feel like now maybe I am crying wolf, why couldn't I focus in that time when I was freaking out, if I had just breathed or immediately taken my medications I wouldn't have caused all of this tension and arguments. What can't I just fix it? I don't know how to handle this, especially what had happened.

Is a hug and being held when your having anxiety the wrong way to do it? Am I causing problems with my anxiety? Will I make him leave over my mental health?

10lrv2r,1674739896,Meditation and mindfulness for anxiety recovery,True,"Hi lovely people :)   


I suffered with intense anxiety and related depression for more than 10 years before I found meditation. Thanks to science, and the miracle work of people such as Dr Joe Dispenza, Deepak Chopra and others, we can now see scientifically that meditation is far from bogus. It has the power to change the brain neurally and neurochemically - meaning, with intention, YOU have the power to change how your brain responds to stimuli. Imagine feeling peaceful and calm in the midst of a previously anxiety provoking situation? With the help of meditation and mindfulness practices, it's definitely possible. If necessary, we can see it on an FmRi brainscan too, and literally see the progress you're making through meditation.   


I didn't believe it at first, and it didn't happen overnight. We could say it takes 21 days to change a habit and 90 days to change a lifestyle, but the relatively little effort could prove to be more than worth it! I changed my lifestyle through meditation and it stuck, I experience very little anxiety these days, and if I do, I can self-regulate and manage it :) This is what I wish for everyone currently suffering with anxiety!   


I encourage you to start very simple, and guided. I use the Calm app for 10 mins a day and I find it to be absolutely brilliant.

Hi yall, i had an anxiety attack yesterday and on last Friday. On both of those days, the morning / early day was physically kind of intense: on Friday i went grocery shopping in 2 different stores, then to join my bsf to help him find some pants, and was hit with an attack in the middle of it that completely wiped me out for hours and hours and forced me to skip an event i had tickets for. Yesterday, i woke up, first thing i did was clean and try to get my (now ex, i think) fwb awake, then vacuumed. I had plans to go to a bingo with my bsf later that evening &gt; it would have been at a bar and we did plan on staying after and dancing/partying. However, the entire day i was kind of constantly afraid of getting an anxiety attack, probably due to what i was told on Tuesday by the guy who slept over (i can tell more, if needed, however it is very triggering) And i did get one. I tried to kind of block it with weed but it didn't hit and i felt so lethargic and terrified and decided i couldn't go to the bingo altough i was very excited for it. 
My friend offered some of his emergency indica, which i smoked so i could sleep it off, because that's usually the only thing that ends it. It didn't really hit either, so i just laid in bed for hours till i did fall asleep properly and woke up this morning. Today i've been trying to take it easy, but i also feel like my daily routine forces me to have intense days, even though i'm on sick leave from my studies. (I can also explain my routine)

I'm a 26 year old male, not overweight. I have some family history of heart issues but only in grandparents who were 50-60 years old in one case and 80+ years old in other cases. What I'm wondering about is if anyone else has this issue of having an elevated heart rate that lasts a full day due to anxiety or even just excitement. What happens to me is that on any day that something out of the ordinary is occurring, my resting heart rate will be 100-140 bpm and never decrease at all. I know it does not decrease because I check it many times throughout the day and it's always this elevated. The cause of it is always mental (or in some cases because I did not sleep enough the night before), and on days where I am relaxed or bored and sleep the full night before, my heart rate is typically in the 60-80 bpm range like a normal person. I guess I'm just wondering if I should be concerned about this elevated heart rate that lasts for a day or more at a time. I'm assuming it places unnatural stress on the heart and will probably lead to some heart related event within a few years (at most) if I don't get it under control, but there's literally nothing I can do to stop it.

10losvf,1674728845,Relaxing music Helps,True,"https://youtu.be/CISazkk6xqI

Relaxing music can have a positive effect on the soul by reducing stress and promoting a sense of calm and well-being. Research has shown that listening to relaxing music can decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increase feelings of relaxation and happiness. Additionally, the slow tempo and peaceful melodies of relaxing music can help to slow down breathing and heart rate, which can promote feelings of calm and tranquility.

Relaxing music can also have a positive impact on the mind and emotions by helping to reduce anxiety and depression. Listening to relaxing music can have a similar effect to meditation, by allowing the mind to focus on the present moment and release negative thoughts and emotions. This can help to improve mood and promote feelings of positivity and contentment.

Moreover, it is known that listening to music can activate the release of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, such as dopamine, which can improve overall well-being, reduce stress, and promote feelings of happiness and contentment.

Overall, relaxing music can be a powerful tool for promoting physical, emotional and mental well-being, and can help to nourish the soul.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10losvf/relaxing_music_helps/,PersonalAnimator8614,
10lom1a,1674728022,Is there anybody who understands?,True,"This might be a lengthy post, and I apologize in advance.

My name is Scott and I wanted to really dig deep and try to explain all of the different issues I face on an every day basis. And I wanted to possibly get a sense of how many others go through at least one or two of the things that I do. I realize that everyone is different and unique, and I am fully prepared to learn that nobody goes through all of the things that I do, however, I am hopeful that at least somebody has a similar ‚Äú life situation‚Äù to mine. What I mean by that is I‚Äôm hoping that somebody in here shares a similar concoction of issues that resembles mine. 

So first of all, I was bullied as a child, and throughout most of my young adult life. Only after high school did it really start to fizzle out. And sadly, I never learned how to properly stand up for myself or fight back. I have developed those abilities slightly as an adult, but most of the time I take any sort of confrontation or bad situations that relate to me and see them as something I did wrong. I attribute them as getting bullied again. 

Another side effect of having been bullied for so long is that I never really learned to hold my own in a tense argument or confrontational discussion. I always find my brain locking up and sort of becoming submissive to whatever is being said. And the end of those situations/conversations usually end up leaving me felt the way I did after I had been bullied. Only after the argument or conversation is done do I find myself rethinking and going over what was just said and wishing I could go back and change how I responded so I could have ‚Äúwon‚Äù that. 

Depression has held my mind and my soul captive for the last 10 years and it has gotten pretty bad. Thankfully, I haven‚Äôt really experienced any serious suicidal thoughts. But I find that I have lost interest in many of the things I once enjoyed, I get easily irritated and angry at situations and people. I find myself always wanting to get even. I especially hate it when people get away with things that they shouldn‚Äôt. And when people do, I find myself wishing and hoping that revenge and karma will come Swiftly to them, even if it‚Äôs something as simple as someone cutting me off in traffic. And I can‚Äôt help but wonder if all of that is caused by the trauma of getting bullied as a child. Because if you think about it, wanting revenge on those who wronged me makes sense. 

My abusive ex introduced me to gambling, and now I have a terrible gambling addiction. I am working on getting help for this.

I have a fianc√© and we‚Äôre getting married in June. But frequently my situations arise and I feel like they bring her down and I feel so incredibly guilty for that. I feel like I might lose her if I am unable to get the help I need. And I never have motivation to better myself. 

I constantly worry about little things. I frequently have a sense of impending doom or that something terrible is about to happen to me. I have a fear that my mental state is going to cause a bunch of physical complications in the near future if they haven‚Äôt already. I‚Äôm 38 so I‚Äôm still fairly young. But I hear the 40s are where many men start to experience a lot of medical complications.

So anyway, I believe that‚Äôs mostly it. If I can think of anything else, I will update this post.

To give some background, last year i experienced anxiety and had a couple panic attacks. Eventually worked through it.

This past week i have been experiencing what i would describe and tightness in my chest (left side) as well the occasional strange feeling (that feeling i cant describe, its somewhat a sore?). I tend to notice this more in the evening when im in bed.

However now im noticing it today along side some aching in my left arm. Do you think this is my anxiety coming back?

I am extremely busy at work currently which is similar to the last time i experienced it.

The problem is that after my experience last year, as soon as i notice it i then overthink it even more which is what i think make its even worse.

my boyfriend got deployed overseas over the summer and it triggered the worst anxiety relapse i've ever experienced. prior to this, i was virtually panic-attack free for 4 years - so happy, very active, very independent. but then i had a string of absolutely horrific panic attacks that left me terrified permanently. it got so bad that i would dry heave, felt like i was going crazy, would hyperventilate, etc. xanax didn't help nor did propranolol, buspar, or hydroxyzine. i used to spend ~8-9 hours out of the house every day and then i virtually stopped going out. now i only go out for the bare minimum. it's been 6 months of this and i'd say i'm considerably depressed at this point. i would've never ever considered myself depressed in the past, this is a first for me. i don't care about the things i used to love - school, my job, friends, doing fun things, traveling. i don't feel joy anymore. my life is dictated by anxiety and panic.

i'm in therapy, always have been. i've tried a whole lot of meds. i typically exercise (lifting) 4-5x/week but the physical symptoms from my anxiety make it impossible now. i do yoga and meditate. none of it works and i feel hopeless. i'm terrified that i'm now stuck like this and that i've lost the vibrant, capable person i once was. i feel like everything about me has changed. i'm terrified i'll lose my boyfriend, friends, and disappoint my family. my greatest fear is continuing to live like this. even the simplest activities have become difficult because of my constant tight throat, racing heart, breathlessness, stomach upsets, etc. i feel terrified of everything nowadays.

10lhs0b,1674702217,how to repair friendships lost to anxiety?,True,"I've dealt with anxiety and depression for most of my life, stemming mainly from childhood trauma; I'm twenty now, and I'd like to say things have gotten better, but the weight of it all follows me everywhere. I'll go months at a time without any major incidents, just the typical day-to-day struggles, then it's like someone flicks a switch in my brain that sends me on a spiral downwards - it's an event that lasts days/weeks, like a constant sinking feeling, just tumbling further and further down and away from myself. I can usually get a grip before things get too bad, but I really fell into a pit last year.

I've never really fit in, always been shy and introverted, so I've never really had a ""crowd"". getting into friend groups I had no hand in creating seemed pretty much impossible for me, so I never really tried. I got into a game called Destiny (kind of like an MMO, so one that requires *some* sort of socialization skills to do the endgame stuff) in 2019, but never had a friendly or consistent group to run stuff with, mainly out of fear of branching out and leaving myself open to others, even in the smallest capacity. In early 2022, I took a chance and joined a clan after battling with myself over it for months, despite how absolutely horrified I was of meeting new people - to my surprise, I found the best friends I've ever had. 

it wasn't easy for me in the slightest, especially in the beginning, but they were 100% on board with helping me integrate into their group. my clanmates didn't care how little I talked, they just appreciated me being there and that was enough for them; ironically, them being so unconditionally supportive of my shyness made me open up to them more than I ever have with anyone else. I spent months getting to know them, becoming a part of their group, actually having a reason to breathe again for the first time in years - then, around June, things changed.

I got hit really, really hard, by some events in my personal life, and my grip on my mental health began unraveling faster than I could control. I fell by the wayside and had completely convinced myself that I had no one and nowhere to go to, so I just disappeared into myself for months. I hated, hated, hated every fiber of my being for doing this, yet I could not stop myself, no matter how much I tried. the fear of hearing them again or seeing their texts was too much, and for no good reason at all. I *knew* they were good people, the best people I know, but I couldn't do anything out of fear that I'd already burned that bridge. 

one of them reached out to me, and I told them where I'd been and what happened to me - they were, as ever, completely understanding and sympathetic. I promised I'd return, then mostly disappeared again. it's been half a year since then, and things have gotten a bit better for me, but I still haven't returned. I know that they miss me, and I love them more than anything, but I just can't yet bring myself to reinstall Discord and see the months worth of messages asking about me, worrying about me. 

I know my friends aren't mad, not enough to push me away, but I'm still so goddamn scared of seeing them again, and I hate it. I hate myself so much. I finally felt like my life mattered, finally had a reason to get up in the morning, and I just threw it away because I was too scared of it. I think the major thing holding me back is just my self doubt, that it'd be easier to see them if I didn't apply my own self-destructive lens to their opinion of me, but I don't know for sure. 

I just need a hand, a word of encouragement, anything. Please, please, help me do this. I don't want to lose them, I just don't know where or how to start.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10lhs0b/how_to_repair_friendships_lost_to_anxiety/,WindSubstantial4852,

Several months ago I also felt quite great pressure in my life, my business went bankrupt because of inflation. Then a few days later, my stomach started to feel strange, aching, cramps, bloating, nausea.

My question, I often read the relationship between the stomach and emotions. But is it really like this? I mean, when the mind is hit by emotions, the stomach doesn't feel anything yet, but after the mind starts to calm down a bit then the stomach feels those symptoms. Sometimes I also don't realize that I'm experiencing stress and only realize after my stomach starts having problems. And when the stomach is affected by the problem earlier, the stress turns into fear or anxiety about deadly diseases.

That's my question, sorry if I'm in the wrong place.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10lgz47/digestive_problems_after_stress/,ivandiryana,

I am struggling to sleep as every time I shut my eyes and try, my heart starts racing, like crazy. Then I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe and wake up in a panic.

I have had some propranolol which has seemed to calm it slightly but still out of sorts. Tried my breathing techniques, distractions of music/videos and currently trying to play some video games as I can‚Äôt seem to get things calm. I even ran my wrists under cold water for a minute! 

I‚Äôve been pretty run down with a cold this week which probably doesn‚Äôt help the stuffiness of breathing but I haven‚Äôt had this issue for sleep in a long time!

Has anyone else had this experience?

I daren‚Äôt wake my partner up for support as he has work early morning and sometimes struggles to get himself out of a deep sleep to support me through this; it‚Äôs nearly 1am in the UK so no one else to talk to either!

Is there anyone awake or available for some support or a chat? Just to keep my mind at ease? I am so scared something awful will happen. I suffer with major Health Anxiety which constantly sets off worse physical sensations.

So i panicked and wanted to change to fall term right away. I emailed the admissions department, but I couldn't sit still. I remember someone told me that they're slow to reply, so i was scared they wouldn't reply fast enough. I cancelled my application for spring term and applied again and PAYING $115 again to apply for fall term instead. My alarm bella were already screaming at me to wait, but I ignored them because I had this fear that if I didn't apply right at that moment that I would be waitlisted..

But the admissions people replied to me the NEXT DAT and was like ""i see you have changed it to fall term instead."" And it made me feel stupid because had I just waited, they would've probably changed it for me and I could've saved $115...

I get to the point where I flush completely red and can't talk at all. It's affected me so much in my life from college to finding jobs. I purposely picked a degree where I thought there wouldn't be much public speaking at all. There was one time we had to do a 15-minute marketing presentation so I messaged the professor telling her I moved randomly and slid my paper under the door. Luckily I passed the class anyway and never ran into that professor on campus again. There was another time I was in a very small class. We had to go around the table of about 5 of us and speak. I was even trembling during that. As for work, I search for jobs that I think won't require any public speaking. I'm terrified of getting a new job and then having to introduce myself in front of a bunch of people. I'm terrified of getting married because I will probably have to speak in front of everyone. I'm even scared of my best friends getting married in case they make me the best man and I have to give a speech. If I know I have any sort of speech coming up it will completely terrify me for weeks in advance and then when the day comes I just can't even do it. I literally have nightmares.

10lbzgs,1674686327,Very sudden waves of panic/anxiety during work even though I have no reason to be anxious?,True,"Was just wondering if anyone else here experiences something similar and/or has any advice for when it happens. Basic overview, I got a new job a month ago and it‚Äôs a dream come true! It‚Äôs in my field and I get to work directly with animals, and my boss and coworkers have been so sweet and helpful. It genuinely feels tailor made for me and I feel so lucky to have gotten the gig.

Only issue is, and this is something that has happened to me before at previous places of work, sometimes randomly during a shift or training, I‚Äôll get this really awful wave of panic throughout my entire body. Like this feeling of, ‚Äúoh god, what‚Äôs happening to me, something‚Äôs going wrong, I don‚Äôt feel right, what if something happens to me when I need to work??‚Äù. Idk how to describe it, but I‚Äôm sure others with anxiety can relate, but it feels so dire in the moment, like life-threatening.

Part of it has to do with the fact that I suffer from a myriad of chronic gastrointestinal-related illnesses, so frequently I‚Äôll have random bouts of stomach trouble. I also have had incidents where I‚Äôve become really faint and thrown up due to stomach issues, my monthly cycle messing with me, etc. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really nervous of having to deal with in a work setting, when I need to be focused, and want to be. So I think subconsciously, that feeling of panic comes from that fear, and then the panic makes me freak out that I‚Äôm gonna faint or throw up or have stomach issues on the clock.

At the new job, when the panic-y feeling comes over me, I‚Äôve just done my best to ride it out as best I can and focus on what I‚Äôm currently doing. It can be difficult, but it‚Äôs worked so far. But it just makes me afraid for when it will happen again, and whether or not I‚Äôll successfully be able to ride it out this time or not.

It‚Äôs so frustrating, because I know I‚Äôm a good worker, and I don‚Äôt want this stupid stuff to get in my way, I just want to be a normal employee. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden or annoying, and I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll eventually be seen that way if I‚Äôm not able to push past it one of these times.

Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to go on too long, that‚Äôs the basic gist of it. Just looking for others who might relate or have some advice. Thanks!!",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10lbzgs/very_sudden_waves_of_panicanxiety_during_work/,TorokoQueen,

I went 2 days after the bite and got 3 vaccines as he didn't die after 10 days, and the last 2 shots weren't necessary.

On January 3rd again, I went to get something from my friend, and he jumped on me (he usually does this) and I felt like he bit me again, but I didn't find any marks, but decided to get anxious anyway. His behavior was completely normal and all.

On January 15th, I was walking when I saw him again, and this time his paw just touched my arm, and left a red mark that disappeared after 2 hours or so, didn't even break skin.

I developed a sore throat about 3-4 weeks back, and now I have a kind of blocked nose and I'm sneezing a bit. My arm has been twitching and hurting slightly for 2 weeks. Every single 'symptom' is rabies. I'm afraid that even if I go to my doctor, he's just going to say I'm fine just as my friends and family are. But the scariest part is when today I went to drink water, thought about being afraid of it, and then I almost couldn't drink it. I couldn't breathe properly later so I think it was a panic attack

Now after all this I'm extremely uncomfortable around dogs, even though I loved them so much. I don't how to get over my fear of dogs right now. I can't avoid encounters with friends' dogs because they don't know about my irrational fears. But all I want right now is to not die of rabies.

But some insight would be much appreciated as I feel like I'm losing my mind right now :/",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10l8wsv/irrational_thoughts_incoming_rabies/,Unfair-Gate-3422,

So, my partner and I are going on vacation in about a month or so and we‚Äôre flying. I haven‚Äôt been on a plane since pre Covid and I always get incredibly panicky right at the start when the doors are going to shut. Like panicky enough to try to get out of the plane. I was getting better but now it‚Äôs 3+ years since the last plane ride and I am already anxious about it (can‚Äôt sleep, elevated heart rate, constant worry). I can‚Äôt think of ways to visualize it because the panic doesn‚Äôt work that way for me. So already I‚Äôm anxious on that, but add in the possibility of getting sick and knowing I‚Äôm going to wear a mask regardless of what people say, makes me more worried about how I‚Äôll breath. 

So that and then the actual vacation itself. I haven‚Äôt been on an out of country vacation in a very long time and never without a family member who knows how to chill me out. My partner has seen a panic attack from me and did awesome about it but I‚Äôm so worried it‚Äôs going to happen on vacation and I‚Äôll ruin everything. I always need to know where a hospital is just in case and it‚Äôs only a half hour away which is awesome but it still doesn‚Äôt quite put my mind to ease. 

I guess I know that I can do this in theory, but that nagging anxious part of my brain won‚Äôt shut off the bad that can happen and not the good. I don‚Äôt want this to ruin this once in a lifetime opportunity.

10l6s4k,1674673781,Should I just give this position a try?,True,"I‚Äôm applying for jobs for first time in a couple years and I stopped doing an application for this one place halfway when I realized the type of retail store it was - I mistook it for another. But they had my email and reached out to me, really eager for someone. 

My spouse is very excited and wants me to take it if I ace the interview. Of course this is the one job out of all my applications that called back and I didn‚Äôt even want once I started application. My qualm with it is that it is a VERY slow job. A tiny store where usually only 10 people a day come in.

Last time I was put in a position like that at my work, I almost quit before a coworker let the management know I was going nuts and they switched me back over to my regular position, which I hadn‚Äôt thought they would so I didn‚Äôt ask. Was couple years ago. I hated everyday of doing it and was going stir crazy. I was having a mental breakdown doing NOTHING. My thoughts go a mile a minute and I have to have some stimuli at all times to help cope. I would try to sneak listening to shows/music in one ear so I didn‚Äôt breakdown. I tried to make myself busy but there was literally nothing more to do. 

I know I would be miserable at this position. The manager herself explained how slow it was so it‚Äôs not my own bias. My husband thinks it‚Äôs good for me but it‚Äôs not. I need a medium paced job where I‚Äôm busy but not overly. And I have plenty other applications that would be that if someone would be interested dammit. My counselor thinks I need to go for what‚Äôs best for me, but marriage counselor challenged me that a position I may think I‚Äôll hate would actually be good. 

But if I don‚Äôt get this job or a job before my spouse comes back from deployment, he‚Äôs divorcing me. So I could either start at this one that would make me miserable, or keep at it with others and hope I get a job in time. It‚Äôs a shit ultimatum and I‚Äôm trying to reframe it in my mind as ‚Äúfuck him and his ultimatum, this is your goal and not his, you need and want this independent of him (which I want to help us and him financially ofc but I‚Äôm speaking about ultimatum), screw his time limit you‚Äôre more than capable, you‚Äôre gonna get a job no matter what whether it‚Äôs on his time or yours, stop letting the fear drive you to meet this goal‚Äù. I think that but it doesn‚Äôt mean I believe it rip. 

My gut says go for ones I won‚Äôt loathe. My fear says take ones desperately even if you‚Äôll start having episodes due to lack of stimulation. I probably should go with my gut but I don‚Äôt want a divorce cos I‚Äôll lose everything. and it‚Äôs completely possible I‚Äôll find another position in the time frame but I‚Äôm catastrophizing ig.

10l6ek3,1674672914,I don't trust my words anymore,True,"TW, I suppose: mentions of gaslighting.

So I(22F) moved to Scotland from Asia about 4 months ago for education and tbh, and I'm still trying to fit in. This is a whole new culture and exposure for me and I just have too much on my plate right now.

I have made quite a good group of friends, all Scottish, and they are pretty accommodating. One of these friends, Max, lives right next to the uni, while I live about 45 minutes away. 

During a chat, I jokingly asked if I can crash at Max's place at night during exam time, as the library closes at 2 am and opens at 6 am if he's alright with it.  I stressed on him being alright with it, even if I wasn't serious-something I also told him- because he lives with roommates and I don't want any problems for anybody. He agreed. And that was the end of it. I did tell him that a situation as such is highly unlikely, but I appreciate it very much.

Recently, Max, me and another friend from the group-Ria, were having a conversation. Max is from a place that I've wanted to visit for a long time, but couldn't due to budget constraints. This was all jokes and laughs, poking fun at each other and teasing. Max joked about how my country seemed gross to him and I laughed it off because we were all joking (the joke makes sense with context). So Ria started planning a tentative trip that might happen sometime in the future to Max's hometown. I joked, saying, ""We all could probably save a lot just by staying at Max's place. No pressure, Max. Do you think you and your family would be okay with it?""

I thought that was the end of it.

Yesterday I got a message from him saying he was uncomfortable with how I invited myself to his place twice without any consideration for his boundaries. That he wasn't angry and still wanted to remain friends but he was upset with the things I had said and was uncomfortable with what I had 'decided on my own' ignoring his opinion.

It hit a nerve. I'm an incredibly introverted and socially anxious person and I struggle with being around people. I don't open up very quickly and struggle a lot. My anxiety sometimes soars up so high that my hands start trembling and I'm unable to think straight. And all of this is something Max is aware of.  

I've been on an anxiety high since yesterday, even zoned out in my lecture because I just couldn't concentrate with that text-conversation in my head and Max sitting right next to me. 

I did apologize to him a lot and admitted that I might have overstepped unknowingly.

He always jokes about how I 'gaslight' him. He'd say about things or events that never happened or tell them falsely and when I'd correct him, he'd say that I'm gaslighting him and laugh it off. Though I am not the only one who corrects him, I'm the only one who gets the 'gaslighting' remark. 

And with all of this and the things he wrote to me in text, I'm starting to wonder if I did say something that was wrong. I know I didn't. I would never. I'm hesitant about inviting people to my house, I would never even think of inviting myself to someone else's place. 

But now I'm scared of being around him and others in our group, worried that I might end up saying something that could be taken up in an entirely different meaning than what I meant. We have a group dinner party coming up and I have half a mind to pull out because I don't trust myself with words anymore.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10l6ek3/i_dont_trust_my_words_anymore/,blissfullytired,

10l50me,1674669679,Start a business while being crippled by anxiety.,True,"  **TL; DR:** I start having anxiety whenever I start working on my business project and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it.

I‚Äôve been wanting to start my business (wedding photographer) for a while now but every time I start to work on it I‚Äôm starting to have anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. I feel like someone is sitting on my chest, it‚Äôs unbearable and I don‚Äôt know how to overcome it.

I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist bimonthly for about 4 months now. We found some of the causes, I have trouble when I‚Äôm faced with a situation where I don‚Äôt have control on something important for me and the person in charge does fuck all and doesn‚Äôt give a shit about what they‚Äôre supposed to do. And it‚Äôs linked to situations I‚Äôve dealt with in the past where this happened and the consequences were dire and hurt me.  
 On the business side it means that I know I will face situations like this again, it‚Äôs part of doing business and I don‚Äôt want it be a problem in the future. I refuse to be defined by that, I don‚Äôt want to be the spectator of my life because of such a thing.  
 Every time it happens I feel guilty for being defeated by my fears, then I feel angry at myself, etc. It‚Äôs a never-ending cycle. I‚Äôm exhausted of not being able to overcome this.

My therapist told me that when it happens, I have to accept my fear in order to stop being blocked by it. That‚Äôs a start. But how am I supposed to achieve that?

 **PS:** I also sometimes doubt my feelings and wonder if I‚Äôm just inventing all of it just because I‚Äôm lazy. I guess it may be related to my father always telling me I was lazy when growing up which, to my knowledge everyone I know disagrees. Anyway, it feels really weird to doubt your own feelings.  
 **PPS:** I‚Äôve been depressed for about 5 years now and on meds (mirtazapine) for a year and a half.

i think that it doesn't help that we don't text often, because i have nothing to prove to myself that i didn't do something that would give her a reason not to be my friend anymore. we're not really close enough where we text daily and we're at a stage where it's not that bad if one of us doesn't reply, but whenever she leaves me on read i feel like a world has ended. logically, i know this isn't the case. she has never given me any reaction that i've done something wrong. we do have a mutual friend who i can ask if i did anything i shouldn't have, but she has told me i was fine. i even brought it up once to this girl who told me that my intuition was wrong and that she did in fact like me as a person. she's always really nice to me, she compliments me a lot, and she's very caring. i'm not sure what it is, but i can't shake this feeling about her. this situation has put me in really dark places since i've known this girl, and it won't go away.

During winter break, I went to the doctor for chest pains, headaches, trouble sleeping and focusing, shortness of breath, etc, thinking it was anemia, but she told me that physically I was fine and that I should get tested for anxiety. My family stigmatizes mental problems a lot since they grew up in a communist country in the late 1980s and my mother especially has always belittled my stress and such my whole life, causing so many other issues. My boyfriend has been very helpful with helping me cope with various things, but he encouraged me to seek professional help too.

10l47sz,1674667797,Does anyone here with health anxiety have legit health issues?,True,"Whenever I search on the web about my health anxiety I only find articles about how people suffer from excessive anxiety about imaginary health issues.

I am the first to admit that my anxiety is excessive (it causes me constant dizziness, lack of energy and I experienced an extremely frightening week of non-stop depersonalization), but **the health issues are very much real**.

In fact, **I started to experience the more intense anxiety after I had the first symptom of an actual health problem** (**optic neuritis,** very common first symptom of Multiple Sclerosis) and the subsequent stays in the hospital, treatment with IV cortisone for days TWICE etc. But the worst of all was probably the fact that **the doctors still haven't diagnosed me properly** (it's certainly an autoimmune disease, seems manageable but we are not sure which one it is) and the **FEAR**.

*It could be MS, lupus and many other things. Will I end up disabled? Will I die early? I hear the side effects of the medicines are very bad. Each doctor tells me a different story and I am not medically trained, how can I make a decision??*

At the same time, my dad had stage 3 cancer and then he almost died of covid. My dog had a dangerous surgery. My sister was in the process of a very difficult divorce on the other side of the Atlantic. I was all alone to manage all of this. Of course it was a lot to handle, I was only 25 when all this started.

Two years later, I still don't know what's going on, but **things are going better**. I am very lucky and I don't take this for granted. So far, I hadn't had any new symptoms and I have 0 liaisons on my brain. My dad recovered from surgery and Covid, finished with his chemo, the danger is still there but smaller. My sister is now almost done with the divorce and even my dog is now doing great!

**But the anxiety is still there!**

Believe it or not, right after the constant fear the second worse thing of having a legit health issue coupled with anxiety is **figuring out which symptom is because of the anxiety and which one could be due to something more serious**. It's also hard to reassure yourself because you **can't say ""it's all in my hear, it's not real""**, because you know that it very well could be real.

I normally have anxiety with thoughts I guess, but it's just something that I've managed by telling myself that it's going to be ok, etc.

Just recently, this past tuesday, I was watching a movie and my legs started shaking a bit, even though I wasn't cold. I started feeling anxious but didn't think anything of it. I tried to sleep but I couldn't, I felt panicked and like I had to ""do"" something. I ended up taking sleep medication to sleep.

I got poor sleep that night, and the following day I was worried that I was going to have trouble sleeping, so I took medication again. I slept fine, and the following day I went to go eat dinner and felt really anxious. I could barely eat anything, and ended up basically eating nothing. I went to bed and slept without medication.


&amp;nbsp;

The next day, I had trouble eating again, and could barely eat anything. The thought of eating made me kind of sick. I barely ate all day, and woke up with my heart racing. It's been 4 days since then, and I've been sleeping OK **without** medication. I've realized this is all tied to anxiety, and the heart racing has mostly tapered off after a few hours of telling myself that I'm fine and that it's going to be ok. Yesterday I was better than today about it, and felt ""myself"" almost all day.

Today I had trouble eating lunch again, and gagged after a few bites. I'm able to eat grapes OK, and a cookie or two. Monday I was able to eat mostly normally, yesterday I only ate half of my lunch and dinner.

I just feel like crying. I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't know how to fix this. Something like this has never happened before. I don't know if I need therapy or what..I contacted a place that specializes in anxiety but they said it would be 4-10 days before an appointment.

The best way to describe it is as a 'rusty feeling'. It's a sense of low-level unease that instantly kills my motivation and enjoyment in whatever it is I'm doing at the time. It's rusty, in that what were once mundane tasks that flowed effortlessly, it now takes more effort to get the same result.

I can be in a great mood and all of a sudden, like a cloud drifting past the sun casting shadows on a beautiful day, this feeling emerges and taints my sense of well-being.

10l33h4,1674665045,When is the time to try medical support for anxiety problems?,True,"TL;RL Is it reasonable to try medications to treat low-level persistent anxiety if verbal psychotherapy doesn't help enough? Are long-term side effects common?

I (30F) have had anxiety issues since at least middle school. Back then I didn't know that such a thing as anxiety exists and getting professional help wasn't an option since I am from Eastern Europe and there was (and still is) serious prejudice against getting psychology/psychiatry help. So I sort of invented some breathing and muscle relaxation exercises that later turned out to be very similar to those that are used in CBT. 

Later, in university, I developed depression and eventually went to see a psychotherapist (psychoanalysis). After three or four years of therapy (and some serious life changes) I managed to mostly deal with depression. Right now I work with another therapist (CBT), continue my breathing and relaxation exercises, keep a healthy lifestyle, keep a journal, meditate... you name it. I dealt with depression, but anxiety issues are still here.

By all accounts, I can be considered functional or even highly functional: I have a decent job, a bunch of hobbies, etc. However, most days, I still have several anxiety fits per day. Physically the symptoms are very mild: some heart pounding (without significant heart rate changes), chills in my chest, and sometimes restlessness. I realize perfectly what is happening and breathing exercises often help. However, the exercises don't help much with purely mental stuff. My concentration sucks, it may take hours before I am able to start working or doing other stuff, my thoughts constantly flow away to some pessimistic scenarios of the future, and so on. 

Sometimes I have 'good periods' when I can maintain a very busy routine that sort of doesn't leave time for me to think and get anxious. It feels pretty good (also boosts my self-esteem), but it's also exhausting, and I never manage to stay in this mode for longer than a few weeks. Overall, according to anxiety tests, I usually have 'low' or 'medium' levels of anxiety. 

Recently I tried to talk to my therapist about getting a psychiatric evaluation (I never had one) and trying some medications. She wasn't very enthusiastic about it, referring to the fact that I think that there is something wrong with me without taking into account stressful events in my life and saying that medications can have unpredictable side effects. She also said that medications are usually prescribed when the condition affects the patient's functionality and recommended visiting a neurologist for some 'mild sedative'. Frankly, I am unconvinced. I have no idea what a 'mild sedative' can it be, and since I live like this for decades, I have no idea whether it affects my functionality or not. What I know is that it takes a toll on me. It's like I have a second job of constantly balancing a glass full of water on my head. While riding a bike.

I know that there is no way to diagnose me without going to the psychiatrist, but at the same time I am afraid to hear the same thing: that since I 'function' normally, I shouldn't take meds. Sometimes I myself think that I overestimate the problem and should just stop paying so much attention to how I feel. At the same time, I am afraid to get a prescription for benzodiazepines. I was shot with diazepam once (for after-surgery muscle spasms) and I understand perfectly why people develop an addiction to this stuff. It was the first time in years that I was able to read several chapters of a textbook in one go.

Bottom line, I'd like to hear some opinions on the subject from those who were in a similar situation. Is it reasonable to try meds even if the anxiety is relatively low and manageable? I feel that if I decide to go to a psychiatrist, I'd feel better if I knew that I have a valid reason for being 'pushy' about meds.

I have suffered from severe anxiety since I got covid in 2020 and I had to spend almost two months locked in my room. When I was allowed to leave the room, I became obsessed with health symptoms, at the beginning around covid symptoms, because I was terrified of getting it again. I became incapable of doing all kinds of social things, and I started to somatize all the symptoms I was terrified about (simple things such as headaches, a small rash in the throat, small goosebumps, etc.), which put me in a loop of fear and obsession, constantly testing myself for covid and hating everyone who did not followed the social distancing rules. I went to a psychiatrist and psychologist, and covid trauma was fading away. However, when covid was not a threat anymore, I started to feel more severe symptoms that related more to life-threatening diseases, such as extreme chest pain (which I thought was a heart attack), severe migraines (which I thought was brain disease), augmented lymphatic nodes (which I thought were cancer). Also, I am a PhD student in neuroscience, so I am more than informed about brain tumors, aneurisms, and all kind of those bad things that I fear the most. I also had a friend of my age who suffered from a brain tumor, so I am aware of those bad things can happen to everyone. 

  
When my medical exams came back clean (I had 2 CT and a MRI), I eventually accepted that my problem was related to a severe anxiety problem, and I was following the treatments as recommended. I was doing better, when, on a trip abroad with my boyfriend, I was hit by a motorcycle at a high speed on a sidewalk. I faced surgery for 6 hours to fix my leg, which had 2 exposed fractures in the tibia and femur and stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks in another country that was not my home. I dealt with the situation just fine, considering the circumstances. I was just grateful that I did not die. My anxiety totally went away. I was focusing on rehabilitation and I felt stupid for wasting my life because of my anxiety. I thought the accident was a life-changing event sufficient to put my anxiety away forever.   
Eight months after the accident, I am almost fully recovered. I don't have permanent damage to my body, and I have everything I need to be happy and to be grateful. Turns out I am not. Out of nowhere, anxiety kicked in again. Some days ago, I felt a little dizzy, and  I started obsessing over it since then. Again, I am afraid that is something wrong with my brain. That I have some kind of severe disease in my brain, and I have to do something about it. My behabiour is exactly the same as before the accident. The dizziness is still present but is not severe, I can do my life normally, but it is there, and I am super aware of that because I can't stop obsessing about it. I just want to do nothing all day, and I am passing way to more time searching in the internet about it, which I know is wrong, but I cannot just not do it.

I've rotated between a few SSRI's and they didn't alleviate anything other than quieting the mind chatter and give me extreme fatigue, feelings of apathy, and no libido. I have a call with my doctor this afternoon to chat about next meds steps.

I want to know if anyone can relate to my experience and how you've coped or found relief. I'm getting super frustrated as the tremors are now starting to affect mundane things like holding a fork and writing. It's like the more focus I give to the task, the greater the panic.

GI doc then switched me to Amitriptyline 10mg which finally helped to stop the nausea and vomiting but I expedited tachycardia and panic attacks non stop daily. Got prescribed Ativan to help. Also tried seroqual 25mg to take my Amitriptyline. Tried for a week and didn‚Äôt touch the panic attacks, which start immediately upon waking up. My GI doc thought I would respond better to Nortriptyline so switched to 10mg. Still experiencing tachycardia, panic attacks that last most of the day. Started seeing a psychiatrist who wants me to start SSRI to help with panic disorder. Tried a tiny dose of Paxil and Zoloft (separate occasions) but led to sever nausea and vomiting. Doc added low dose of Mirtazapine ( half of a 7.5 mg pill) to help with my appetite as I‚Äôm losing weight. Long story short, I‚Äôm in a constant state of panic with tachycardia, shaking, and hold cold flashes. I have to take Ativan several times a day to help.

10ky7et,1674652012,Health anxiety and coffee is making it worse?,True,"Hi. 

I am a med student. It‚Äôs my first year of university and I am doing great, when it comes to grades. 

However, during the winter break I developed health anxiety. 

Firstly, I was thinking I was too close to having a heart attack. I caught up a cold during that time, which made me feel even worse. Hence, I went to get tested thinking it would be Covid, but luckily, I was negative. I also requested to get my bloodwork, and everything was great, with WBCs almost over the normal amount, which I expected, since well, I had a could duh. 

That eased my anxiety quite a lot. However, it did not stop there. Then, I started thinking I have different types of cancer and how I am ill, without even knowing. However, even though I do not have any symptoms of having any kind of illness, let alone the mentioned, I still feel anxious. Even though I did the bloodwork, I sometimes think It‚Äôs fake‚Ä¶ 

The anxiety started making my palms and feet sweat, not too much, but still enough for me to take it as a sign that I have the worst diseases possible. 
In the meantime, I stopped drinking coffee for no reason, It just came to me.

Today I tried drinking coffee again, and it caused my anxiety to skyrocket. My palms and feet started sweating again(not a lot obviously), my anxious thoughts got much worse and I started feeling jittery and cold. 

During the period without coffee, I was definitely feeling better and less anxious.

I was wondering if anyone has similar symptoms after drinking coffee? I have definitely decided to give up on it, since it is most likely bad for me.

10kwdyn,1674645606,Summary of research into the experience of sex and sexuality in women who have OCD,True,"In 2018 I was very kindly allowed to advertise my doctorate research on this subreddit, which explored the impact of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) on women‚Äôs lived experience of sex and sexuality. I wanted to share a summary (please see below) now that it‚Äôs complete and to say a big thank you to participants and also the moderators for allowing me to advertise my research.

Study Overview:
In this study I explored women's lived experiences of sex and sexuality with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and how the impact of OCD on sexual identity and practices was managed, and also how seeking support was experienced.

Background to the study: 
I could find virtually no research, and no research that captured women‚Äôs experiences in their own words, that explored experiences of sex and sexuality for women with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There was, however, a small number of (mostly statistical) studies that indicated women with OCD were likely to experience sexual problems. Without an evidence base around women's experiences in this area to inform interventions, it was difficult to know how therapy could best help women with OCD.

Who took part? 
One hundred and thirty-four women answered a series of questions online in their own words. One Skype interview was also undertaken. Overall, the study was predominantly completed by women living in the US in their mid-twenties, who identified as white, cis-gendered, middle class, able-bodied, and who were in a relationship and full-time employment. The majority of participants used a variety of labels to describe their sexualities, with less than half of participants identifying as heterosexual. The average age of OCD onset was 10. With regards to the use of medication, the majority of women taking part had used it to manage their OCD symptoms, and of those women, the majority reported finding it useful. However, of the women who took medication, a large number felt it had negatively impacted their interest in sex, ability to orgasm, and it had increased the time it took for them to orgasm.

How were the data analysed? 
The findings were reported under four headings which captured the key elements of women‚Äôs experiences: ""OCD as fake news"" - difficulties distinguishing between an OCD intrusive sexual thought and a ‚Äòreal‚Äô sexual thought; ""OCD as sex killjoy"" - avoiding sex to avoid intrusive thoughts; ""What is normal sex?"" ‚Äì how society‚Äôs stereotypes of sex interact and exacerbate women‚Äôs experiences of OCD, sex and sexuality; and ""To share or not to share?"" - the dilemma of talking about OCD and sex/sexuality in therapy.

What did the study find? 
Overall, it was common to feel a deep sense of shame around intrusive sexual thoughts and compulsions, which resulted in feelings of isolation due to avoiding sex and, in some cases, partner relationships. It was also common not to share OCD experiences with partners or therapists. Compulsions resulted in some women finding themselves in risky situations in the hope of proving that their OCD intrusive thoughts were wrong. At times sex was also engaged in for the sake of partners even when it was a distressing experience due to intrusive thoughts. Sex was also engaged in as a way to manage intrusive thoughts and to stop something 'bad' from happening. The lack of certainty around sexuality (sexual orientation) caused a great deal of distress. There was a strong need for acceptance from therapists, rather than judgement about sexuality and intrusive OCD thoughts, as a high level of negative self-judgment was already experienced.

What needs to happen in the future? 
The study identified that therapists required further training around OCD and sex/sexuality to empower women with OCD to have enthusiastically consensual and pleasurable sex. One of the aims of publishing my research in an academic journal is to inform a better understanding of sex and sexuality for women with OCD among therapists. Also, more information is needed more widely in society to ensure that women do not feel they are the only one experiencing distress resulting from OCD related to sex and sexuality, hopefully cultivating a sense that you are not alone.

Thank You! 
Lastly, I would like to thank anybody reading this who took part in my study, because without you this research would not have been possible. I also want to thank you for being extremely kind and generous by sharing so much with me and for trusting me with the intimate details of your OCD.

10kvdc9,1674641413,New medication- it's AMAZING!,True,"I just have to share this. I'm a 32 year old man. I've been on and off antidepressants most of my life. None of them ever helped me and I've decided and told my doctor/ therapist that I am never taking any antidepressant ever again. I'm done with them. 

I take two different kinds of benzodiazepines as needed. I have struggled with addiction to these meds in the past but I am learning to ""moderate"" and truly take them as needed. Honestly I don't even like benzos that much overall. Sometimes they are wonderful and I do genuinely need them but other times they just make me feel sick and more depressed. (I take them for my anxiety). I would prefer to just never take them or take one or two a month. I'm working on that.

I recently was doing research and asked to be prescribed Baclofen for anxiety. I honestly didn't expect it to do anything. Within 40 minutes it was like my depression and anxiety were GONE. Not just reduced/manageable (as I feel with benzos) but literally gone. I thought- ok, this must just be a placebo effect. And I thought I shouldn't get my hopes up.

I've been taking it for a couple weeks now, as needed. For example yesterday I took Baclofen as prescribed. Before that I didn't take it for two days. I'm going to take it again today. 

Positive effects: total elimination of depression. Major reduction in anxiety. No negative effects at all (unlike benzos and especially antidepressants). 

The thing is- I didnt actually realise how profoundly depressed I was until I started this medication. I always told people I have severe anxiety but only a mild depression, sometimes moderate. Man was I wrong- I've been suffering from severe depression but I was so used to it and didn't know any different.

I'm actually laughing out loud now and smiling- not forcing laughter or faking it anymore. It's amazing. Baclofen is better than benzos- much less addictive, as far as I can tell no side effects. Why isn't this being prescribed more? 

Doctors and therapists need to get off the antidepressant wagon. I'm so sick of being told to take a medication that can take months to work, make you feel worse/ more suicidal when there are meds like Baclofen that work immediately for some people.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10kvdc9/new_medication_its_amazing/,Decent-Author-6671,

English is not my first language so excuse me if this sounds weird.

I can't sleep because my head's trying to convince me with all its might every small body sensation is a sign that I'm dying tonight (please, be merciful and don't suggest me to go to a doctor or suggest reasons for my random body pains, I wouldn't be able to handle it).

To give you an idea on how bad it is, I spat a little blood after brushing my teeth and somehow managed to reach the conclusion that my lungs are hurt, despite me not feeling anything.

10kttyt,1674634908,Anxiety about work,True,"Hi I am a late 30s man who has been working in the construction industry (office based financial side) for about 20years. 

In my private life I would consider myself to be a bit of a worrier but it is manageable. I do generally go straight to worst case scenario in my head straight away however.

This is even more the case when my mind switches to work. I have a real fear of making a mistake at work. Of not being able to do the job. Of making a fool of myself. Of going through worst case scenarios and not being able to handle it. Of not being able to handle the workload. 

The worst time is first thing in the morning when I wake in bed. If my mind goes to work I will be in cold sweats, feeling sick, heart racing etc. Usually when I get to work and actually ""work"" I am fine.

From the outside I probably look like I am doing fine. I have a good well paid job in good construction company. I have never been reprimanded for quality of work.
Despite this I have a severe case of Imposter Syndrome.

About a month ago, I made a switch from Dove deodorant to one without aluminum.  When my anxiety vanished, I racked my memory trying to figure out what changed.  When I realized the only change was the deodorant, I looked into it as I thought the switch was only aluminum free.  As it turns out, Dove contains multiple endocrine disrupters including BHT.  These impact the estrogen levels in our bodies.  Applying Dove so close to lymph nodes, I can‚Äôt help but wonder if no longer putting BHT everyday has helped level out my hormones and therefor my anxiety.  I am not saying this is a quick fix but something to consider and try.  I couldn‚Äôt find any research this specific.

10klvq6,1674608652,I (18F) can't live life without my boyfriend (18M),True,"To start, me and my family plan to have my long distance boyfriend move up here with us in a small town up north (I'm in Canada btw). His parents don't know about this, and they're really strict too. There's a 4-5 hour distance from my house to his. He's struggling in college rn and is struggling to get a job. He has no money and no car either.   


Anyway um.. I have really bad anxiety. Social anxiety, separation anxiety, GAD, and mild agoraphobia. I also overthink the shit outta everything and imagine all the worst possible scenarios. I can't be left alone, I very rarely leave my house, I can't talk to anyone at school, I can't even go downstairs alone to meet my dad in the car, or go outside and be in public without being anxious. I don't have a job yet, I don't have a driver's license, I haven't even worked on my community hours for grad and I'm 2 weeks away from my second semester. I also can't cook. Basically, I'm not ready for what the world has to offer. I can't live an actual life due to what I struggle with.  


I'm so dependent on my boyfriend for everything. He's the complete opposite of me in terms of being able to do things in this world, like go places, talk to people, cook, drive, whatever. Since I can't really function in this world, I'm extremely worried how life will be if he somehow dies, whether that be before or after he's up here with me. I literally NEED him to live life. I can't do anything on my own and since I'm up here in the middle of nowhere, once my grandparents parents die, I'm fucked if he dies too. There is my aunt who's hours away but idk if she would help me. I would have nobody else to rely/depend on. I have one ""friend"" up here at my school (she's not really a friend, just someone I sometimes spend time with at lunch) and all my irl friends are down in the city who are a couple years younger than me.  


As I'm writing this, I'm so incredibly scared, anxious and it's like I'm on the verge of tears just THINKING of the idea of my boyfriend dying one day when I NEED him to have a life. I have a feeling I'll have a severe mental breakdown, cry on the floor, and end up ending myself due to severe stress and anxiety if this happens. I'm not independent at ALL. My dad had me sign papers for Ontario Works  and we're thinking of like- putting me on a disability? So I don't have to work? (I don't quite understand it.) Idk how life will be if I'm alone.

10kl7er,1674606772,Not feeling anxious but heart rate jumps up and down?,True,"First ever Reddit post! 
So background:  got a terrible flu A a month ago.  Started to feel palpitation at that time,  never seriously felt palpitation before unless I am really anxious.  So I started to monitor heart rate with Apple watch.  And got a bit of info about how my heart rate is normally.  Sitting and watching TV it's usually at 60-65 zone.  Standing quietly:  70-75 ish. 

I had 1 normal ekg at Dr office and a normal 24 hr holder monitor 3 weeks ago.  So my pcp isn't very concerned.  I still feel palpitation from time to time and I just cannot do usual exercise routine. Like even climbing stairs makes me feel faster heart rate and I  got so scared and tired.  So I pretty much just sit all day for the past 1 month since flu.
Because i still have symptoms and just generally not feeling Like myself.  So I am still monitoring everything: 

The first few weeks,  when I feel palpitation,  usually the heart rate is still normal looking.  But then for the past week,  i noticed 2-3 cases where I was sitting and watching TV,  I started to feel palpitation and my watch is showing palpitation goes like 65-80-68-78-75-74-68-82 in just a few seconds.  
This is just scary.  I always have anxiety about health even though I never went to see a psychiatrist and just began to work with a therapist. 
Does this possible with anxiety?  I mean I was not feeling anxious emotionally when jumping dancing of heart rate happened.  But I just learned that ppl with anxiety can have physical symptoms out of no where. 
P. S.  I only started to feel small episodes of anxiety emotionally,  episodes that come on out of blue since 9 month ago. That's when my mother was diagnosed with Cancer.  She was said to only have 2-3 months in the beginning but I did a lot to find her an expert for her rare Cancer and she is still surviving and had progress with treatment.  But that 2-3 months definitely hit very hard on me not speaking I was 2 month postpartum.  So it's possible that I always have background health anxiety without knowing until my moms diagnosis and then I had apparent anxiety emotions and then a bad virus hurts and now boom.

10kkycf,1674606072,For those of you freaked out by this Earths Core hogwash..,True,"

The Earth's inner core is the solid, innermost layer of the Earth that lies beneath the liquid outer core. Scientists have long suggested that the inner core spins faster than the rest of the Earth, a phenomenon known as ""super-rotation."" This is thought to be caused by the magnetic field generated in the liquid outer core, which exerts a torque on the solid inner core. However, there has been ongoing debate about the exact rate of this super-rotation and whether it is constant or changes over time.
Recently, a study by Yang &amp; Song (2023) has added new information to this debate by suggesting that the rate of super-rotation oscillates on a multi-decadal scale, and that at the moment, the rate is close to zero. This does not mean that the inner core has stopped rotating or reversed direction, but rather that it is rotating at approximately the same rate as the rest of the planet. The study suggests that the rate of super-rotation varies between being slightly faster, about the same, or slightly slower than the rest of the planet, and that these variations change semi-periodically.
It's worth noting that the rate of super-rotation is determined by the difference in angular rate between the inner core and the rest of the planet, this means that super-rotation can happen in any direction, not only in one direction.
The potential effects of this oscillation on other Earth systems are currently speculative and more research is needed to investigate connections to other similar oscillations. It's also worth mentioning that this oscillation is not new and it's not catastrophic, scientists have been aware of this phenomena for a while now and they are still trying to understand the extent to which it connects to other oscillations with similar periods.

My issue is that I feel like everything is my fault, or that I'm constantly messing up and need to apologize. It's making it hard to maintain good relationships with the people I care for. I don't have many friends and I'm trying to avoid driving away the ones I do have. If they go awhile without speaking to me, or go offline without saying anything beforehand (online friendships) I end up assuming they hate me and I'll have the urge to hurt myself or worse, if I'm feeling vulnerable enough. I'm really sick of living like this, and since I'm an adult I feel like I should've grown out of this type of behavior ages ago.

10kimss,1674600154,Anxiety about downstairs neighbours,True,"I'll try to make this short. I need help on perspective.

3 years ago my downstairs neighbor (DN) complained about humid problems. Not a word from them until last year, he got a kid and naturally the problem got bigger. There was a lot of rain over the past few months. With the help of ""head neighbor"" we fixed the drain but the problem persisted. On some places the humid was lost but on some other it got bigger. 

The construction worker told us that the problem is on our terrace because of poor Hydroisolation. 

DN didn't want to help and only cared about results. I have getting daily reminders from them that the problem is here and that I have to fix it. His mother in law is the owner and calls me every time there is rain.

Because they were so asertive we called a worker who unfortunately did mistakes and removed some of the drain and now the rain from our terrace is pouring over the facade of the building. I didn't get a receipt and the worker won't answer hiss cell phone. We didn't have time to find a proper worker. The problem on the DN side got bigger.

Lucky I've found a good construction workers who will (at least I hope) fix everything when the weather calmes down. I should get a work guarantee. They did a good inspection and found out that the problem is maybe even in the facade so that I shouldn't be at blame for everything. I am keeping this information as a last resort if the DN starts a legal process against me or if the problem persist even after their work.

Now, the DN and owner call me every day and threaten me with lawyers and such. I have told them on multiple occasions that the problems will be solved when we get normal and dry weather. And that I will gladly pay for any damage done, once the problem is removed.

After the 4th call this week, I have snapped and told them that I cannot control the weather and the timing of construction workers. I didn't back down and hold my ground affirming that I am not to blame and that I am doing everything in my power to fix everything. 


I am angy (because they won't listen to reason and don't want to help in any way), sad (because I really do feel sorry for them), also sad because I cannot sleep normally when it rains because I know they will call again.

 I am working on my mental health and this is taking a big tool on me. I blame myself for offering my help in the first place and for letting an inexperienced worker to do the Hydroisolation job. 

I feel a bit afraid of what is my DN is capable. 
The anxiety part kicks in every time I see a raindrop. Overthinking every possible outcome of our fight and how much will everything in the end cost. 

A lot of my friends are telling me that I am doing the right thing and sadly got in problems with toxic and abusive people.

10khacm,1674596878,I feel I may as well be dead,True,"I live with so much anxiety and depression every day. Most days at 4am I wake up with nausea, my heart racing, hands trembling, the urge to breathe fast and hard and tension in my forehead. Every single morning I will have to get out of bed to vomit. I've unintentionally lost 7kg in a fast period of time because I have no appetite even though I try so hard. 

I've started smoking cannabis and cigarettes all day everyday to lessen the nausea and anxiety even though I don't like it that much and know it is bad.

I hate being awake no matter the setting. I am slowly becoming less and less functional and leaving the house less and less. I don't enjoy any activity. I could be on a holiday in paradise and I would still feel the same.

Let alone work... I have two jobs at the moment. One I am self employed and the other is casual work. In the past I have been quite high energy and able to fit a LOT on my plate. But I'm struggling with a tiny fraction of what I'd normally have on. 

I've run out of money to go back to the psychologist or even the doctor without asking someone.

I feel so hopeless and like it will never get better. Previous to this I was suffering pain every day from a medical condition most days in the last year. I don't think I've truly had many ""good"" days between that and this.

Most of the time I am awake I wish I was asleep because that's the only time I get relief.  
Which is what brings on the suicidal thoughts. If I'm dead, then I never have to be awake again. 

The only thing truly keeping me from doing it is that my parents are still alive and I wouldn't do that to them. But that doesn't stop the obsessive thinking about it or the feeling. I know exactly how I would and I would make sure it works.

I was on lexapro for a year. Then started losing weight and vomiting multiple times a day so with doctor advice I weaned myself off but only managed 3 days completely off with no relief of the vomitting. It was found that the cause was a misplaced IUD which I had to get removed.

I have started taking Prozac and am on day 9 and I know all these thoughts are normal during the adjustment period. The thing that worries me is that these thoughts come up frequently for a long period of time and nobody seems to take my seriously when I tell them. I have told my psychologist multiple times but we haven't really done anything about it.

10kgraz,1674595593,Anxiety almost did me in today - First job interview in years.,True,"I'm a long time anxiety sufferer who just had his first job interview in 4 years.  What happened today was a cascade of one anxiety after another.

By way of background, I quit my last job because of anxiety issues dealing with co-workers and decided to go back to school for a masters degree (data science.)  I'm almost done the degree and decided to try and get an internship.  I was able to get a Zoom interview scheduled today with a major company.

So here is the cascade of anxiety-producing horrors that befell me today:

1.) I print out a copy of my resume to have during the interview when questioned.  I panic as I look at the long stretches of unemployment and struggle to come up with good explanations.  In my mind, I believe that no one will ever hire again for any good job.

2.)  I print out the LinkedIn bio's of the people interviewing me today.  They both have PhD's from prestigious schools and have serious research accomplishments.  I already have severe imposter syndrome and I feel so inferior and dumb.  I panic I will expose my lack of intelligence.

3.)  I start setting up my laptop for the interview.  I can't find a clean professional camera angle in my bedroom so I frantically have to tear the room apart so I can just sit in front of a blank wall (moving major pieces of furniture.)  I then get a look at myself through the Zoom camera.  I'm horrified how I look.  I hate the way my face looks - especially my nose.  I get embarrassed at how I look and think the interviewers will mock me internally.  I then look at my skin and hair.  I can't believe how old I look - age lines and graying temples.  I think I'm probably too old now to ever get hired again. (early 40s.)  So, I decide I need a crappier camera.  I get an older laptop with a less resolute camera.  Now, I need to find an acceptable angle.  I pile almost every book I have on a table to get the right height.  Then I find the angle isn't flattering, so I have to put folded up pieces of paper to under the back of the laptop to shift the angle downward.  I finally get a good angle, but now I'm worried the whole tower will collapse in the middle of the interview.  Then I fiddle with the lighting. I contort these various USB lights to get a satisfactory lighting that doesn't make me look too old.

4.)  Next I test the audio.  The laptop audio sounds like crap, so I decide try my airpods mic.  That sounds like crap too.  Finally, I resort to a full headset with a mic.  The audio tests sounds great, but now I look like a dork.  I'm anxious they won't think I look professional.

5.)  I decide to wear a jacket and tie and realize I forgot how to tie a tie.  I have to scramble for videos on the easiest tie tying techniques.  I finally get it tied.

6.)  I'm finally 10 minutes from the interview and I realize I can't find my suit jacket.  I throw everything around my room looking for said jacket and don't find it.  I frantically run through the house looking for it.  I finally find it hanging on the back of the bathroom door ( I took it off when I was attempting to tie my tie.)  I get back to laptop 2 minutes before the interview started.

7.)  I enter the Zoom room and no one else is there at the appointed time.  I wait five minutes and then wonder if I did something wrong.  Did I accept the wrong Zoom invite?  Did the interviewers wait a few minutes and then give up?  Well, finally the interviewers arrive about 10 minutes late and apologize for their lateness and commence the interview.

I mean, the interviewers were very nice and respectful and really didn't hammer me much about my periods of unemployment.  There was a personality set of questions that I think I did OK with.  I stammered a bit at first, but then got more comfortable as things went on.  The technical question portion wasn't hard per se in that there was no question I couldn't answer.  I think they were wanted to see the richness and detail of your answer.   After the interview ended, I thought of a lot more I wish I included.

Anyway, I have no idea if I'll get the internship, but I thought it might be worth sharing what living with anxiety can be like.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10kgraz/anxiety_almost_did_me_in_today_first_job/,Over-Pay3608,

10keoqq,1674590636,I've been struggling with anxiety about falling asleep and it's led to a severe addiction to OTC sleep aids,True,"I've been quietly struggling with this issue for the last 10 years and am finally reaching out to see if anyone has advice or has struggled with this issue themselves.
&amp;nbsp;

Every night I have anxiety about falling asleep/getting enough sleep for the next day. Right, when I'm about to fall asleep, my body goes into panic mode--my heart starts beating faster, I start sweating, and am instantly wide awake. This happens on repeat every night and eventually turns into anxiety about not getting enough sleep for work or wherever I have to be the next day.

&amp;nbsp;


I've been prescribed Ambien and Xanax in the past for this issue and formed a habit where I was eventually buying those medications off the street, so I could take more than what the doctor would give me. It became a big problem in my life and I ended up losing a job because of it. 

&amp;nbsp;


It was a long road, but I was able to overcome my addiction to those meds, which effectively put me back at square one. 

&amp;nbsp;


I then started taking Melatonin daily, which over time, led to larger and larger dosages, so I added Diphenhydramine to help compensate. My dosages of both continued to get larger, so I added in Doxylamine Succinate. During this time, I was also prescribed Seroquel, which thankfully, I've had enough self-control to not abuse. I've tried to quit on multiple occasions with little success. I go into withdrawal and it has a significant impact on both my personal and professional life.

&amp;nbsp;


I'm now at a point where I take upwards of 40 - 10mg Melatonin pills, 10 - 50mg Diphenhydramine pills, 5 Doxylamine Succinate pills, and 1 - 100mg Seroquel. I spend about $1,500 per year on sleep aids. I can take all of these pills and still stay awake all night because of my anxiety/tolerance. 

&amp;nbsp;


I feel hopeless. Like I'll never be able to pull myself out of this massive tolerance hole I've dug myself into. Physically, I feel like garbage. My sleep barely feels like sleep anymore. I never feel rested. I feel perpetually dehydrated. I've never shared this with anyone around me. I've felt weak and embarrassed to admit to myself, let alone anyone else, that I have a problem that's out of control. Some really close friends know I take sleep aids, ""sometimes"", but no one knows things are this bad for me. I try to practice good sleep hygiene with nightly meditation, use of blue light filters/glasses, and spending minimal time in bed doing things that are not sleeping (such as watching tv or eating). I've seen a Neurologist and have had two sleep studies that went nowhere because I had too much anxiety to fall asleep and ended up just laying in bed awake the entire time. Has anyone struggled with this before? Idk what to do anymore, but I need to figure this out because I cannot continue to live like this. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have to change clothes multiple times if something about the outfit makes my body even a little bit uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt seem to do homework; I have 2 incomplete grades from last semester. I am frequently avoiding going to school. I am unable to go to my gym where I train with some of my friends. I am avoiding doing an important part of my job because it makes me uncomfortable (just asking for tips) which is a problem because it is how my coworkers and I make most of our money. I bought stuff to begin sewing because I can avoid other things. I spend too much time on YouTube because I can have noise on that allows me to avoid my thoughts. I cannot shut my brain up and I can‚Äôt soothe my anxiety. I can‚Äôt figure out how to make myself feel better so I am constantly at a 7-8 out of ten on the anxiety scale.

I just want my brain to be calm, I want to be able to make decisions and save money and actually keep things of mine clean because I keep letting messes pile up so then I have an excuse of needing to clean. I want to be able to keep track of my thoughts and not let them spiral into panic attacks which I keep triggering over the most minor things. 

I just can‚Äôt figure out how to cope through this because it is so physical and I take my anxiety meds sparingly because it is addictive and I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on it. And I just can‚Äôt manage to do all these things that I need to do. 

Even the idea of posting this is hard and I‚Äôve typed this so many times, but I keep avoiding asking for help. I just started seeing a new therapist, so haven‚Äôt had time to get to the root of all of this, and can‚Äôt see my psychiatrist for a while even though I tried making an earlier appointment. 

I just need some coping mechanisms that will help prevent me from avoiding all these problems and allow me to have consistent comfort and not feeling like I‚Äôm always in flight mode. I‚Äôm tired of feeling isolated because people really cannot understand this severe anxiety, they don‚Äôt understand that I feel like I‚Äôm dealing with true fear and I can‚Äôt just push through because it makes me ill. 

Does anyone know what I should do or how to manage until I can develop a better plan with my therapist?",2,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10ke1vr/using_avoidance_as_a_coping_mechanism_for_anxiety/,Sad-Mathematician485,

I hate asking for help or asking people to do work for me. I work in an admin job so I usually don‚Äôt have to do that. People are usually coming to me for help, which I don‚Äôt mind.

I‚Äôve been given a project that‚Äôs way out of my comfort zone. Mostly because I have to connect with people outside of my department and I‚Äôll be asking them to do some complicated work for our department. I don‚Äôt know anyone so casually dropping by someone‚Äôs desk is tough. (I don‚Äôt know where everyone sits and I would have to come back if they are in a meeting or out.)

I‚Äôd rather send each person an email with the details of what we are asking. Because of the anxiety of a new job, new people, and asking people to do something for me. But also because the project has a lot of details.

But...is the better solution to talk to them in person? Will they be more willing to do the tasks for me if I do? They might have more questions with an email?

10kduls,1674588588,My anxiety just *latches* onto my dad,True,"Recently I‚Äôve been struggling with overstimulation to the point of really severe panic attacks, multiple times per day. I shut myself in my room all day with noise-cancelling headphones because anything else is too anxiety-inducing. 

My dad is an obnoxiously loud person. Everything is exaggerated. Every bite of food is accompanied by loud lip smacking and chewing, every yawn is a shout, every footstep echoes. I‚Äôm on the other side of the house to him right now with my headphones on (just the noise-cancelling feature but no music) and I can still hear him. He is so fucking loud. I can‚Äôt be around him without having a panic attack and I hate him for it. 

And the thing is, I‚Äôve asked him to be quieter in the past and explained how it would set off my anxiety. Specifics too, like I‚Äôve asked him not to smack his lips and not slam doors etc. And he stops in the moment (or the next 2 minutes to be more realistic) and then he goes back to how he always is. So I‚Äôve stopped asking him to be quieter because I know it doesn‚Äôt change anything and just makes me seem mean. But I hate him so much because of it, and then I hate myself so much for hating him over something so small. 

Sometimes I just want to *make* him be quiet. It‚Äôs horrible and violent and disgusting and I‚Äôd never actually hurt him and I shouldn‚Äôt have these thoughts about anyone, especially not my own dad, but I get so angry and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10kduls/my_anxiety_just_latches_onto_my_dad/,stay2426,

10kdbc7,1674587259,Coping with the ceaselessness of time and the inevitability of death.,True,"Hey all, I'll try to make this short.

I work as a firefighter/paramedic.  Needless to say I see a lot of bad things on a daily basis.  Within the last year, my 50 year old mother was also diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.

The things that I saw never used to bother me, and I never paid much attention to the fragility of life and the passing of time.  I just went about daily life, naive and ignorant, thinking that me and everyone I love is invisible.  That living 250 miles away from home, everything would stay the exact same as when I left it, nobody would get older, everything would always be okay.

But over the last several months, I've really begun to worry about it all, to the point where my mental stability is barely hanging on by a string.  The emergency calls bother me, because I picture my loved ones going through similar circumstances. I've had quite a few mental breakdowns recently.  I'm worried for my mom, because I know what death entails, I've seen it, and it isn't pretty.  I'm worried about my grandparents, who are getting old.  I worry about my father and my stepfather who are out of shape and have loads of medical problems.  And I worry about my five younger siblings... how they will be able to manage in this horrible world, how I can take care of them when our parents pass away.

I never used to fear these things.  I know that everybody has to go through this, it's just a part of life.  I'm no different than anyone else.  But I miss the naivety that I once had, that feeling of invisibility.  I'm not religious, and I can't even try to pursue that with what I see at work and with what's happening to my mom. But I so envy the peace of mind that religious folks have.

I guess what I'm after are coping mechanisms... I work out relentlessly, eat healthy.  I have hobbies.  I try to drive two states away and spend as much time as I can with family (though it never seems like enough, which stresses me out further).  I go to therapy, which doesn't seem to help.  I don't have bad addictions like drugs or alcohol or gambling.  And yet I'm still barely hanging onto sanity.

Does anybody else have any advice on how to not be paralyzed by this fear? It's impacting every aspect of my life... my job, my sleep, my fitness, and my relationships.

However, in the mornings when I know something is coming up, Il specifically wake up feeling nauseated, having a nervous energy similar to restless legs and difficulty sleeping. This gets worse if I continue to sleep and then wake up again due to the nerves. 

As the day goes on I go back to normal and even though theres still anxiety there the effects are *way* down. Depending how the morning went it may take longer, I've had the nausea last hours before. 

One other thing to note is that I have found it to actually alleviate the feelings of nausea if I move around, do light exercise and such when I'm feeling it.

I'd call myself an anxious person but I think I've grown to understand myself better and I manage my emotions very well.

I just wanted to subtly encourage him to perhaps read up more and try to discover some things so he can help himself.

He replied with a sad statement that I'm hinting to him that he's not paying enough attention and that he knows he sucks.

Once my doctor suggested I should increase the dosage for my recent heightened anxiety, I was definitely hesitant just because that in itself gives me anxiety and instead of jumping to 150mg I asked if I could try 125mg first, but Dr said that increasing by 50mg is pretty standard and told me to try it, so here we are. 

Last night I was feeling a little panicky after having some anxiety induced over-thinking and intrusive thoughts. I had a really hard time sleeping last night, waking up every couple hours, when I normally don‚Äôt have this issue at my 100mg dosage. Today I‚Äôm feeling tired, which makes sense considering I slept poorly, but I‚Äôm having a hard time focusing on my work and still having some intrusive thoughts.

I was on Wellbutrin for awhile and weened off of it last year after feeling it wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me.

I do vape nicotine throughout the day and have one cup of coffee in the morning that I sip on throughout the day. Giving both of these up would be ideal but they‚Äôre currently my only crutches. I was a heavy daily weed smoker for last 3-4 years and kicked that habit about a month ago after feeling like it was just making my anxiety worse.

Normally I'm not very open to showing my emotions so when I would hide out in the garage I thought I was just overwhelmed. Our marriage ended due to infidelity on her part and I ended up alone with our 3 kids because she didn't want to be a mother anymore, prior to that I'd worked 3 jobs to keep everything afloat because she didn't want to work (I'd often be away from home for 5 days at a time, sleeping in the family car between shifts). I met someone new and it's been close to 3 years now. My girlfriend and I have a baby together and we are currently living together. I'm finally going through the divorce process with my ex-wife but while I spent the last 3 years being a parent and spending all my money taking care of my family and expensive CA rent, she just saved up and now she's dragging me through the CA court system for full custody, claiming abuse and neglect on my part. I know she's wrong, but she's also been allowed to remove the kids from my home and enroll them in a school close to her. I tried to fight it in the courts but I nearly lost my job missing work to go to the courthouse, plus I had to push my move in date to my new apartment by over a month and I've been playing catch up on all my bills since.

10k6iy1,1674569980,My Journey On Lexapro‚Ä¶.,True,"I (19F) just took my first pill of escitalopram (Lexapro) and I feel nervous! I wanted to go day by day updating my symptoms and how i‚Äôm feeling to possibly make others less nervous to start as well. I‚Äôm hoping for the best!

Day One: Just took 5mg at 9:00 am because my doctor said it could make me feel more awake. That is strange because my therepist told me it might make me more sleepy! I think it‚Äôs a case by case basis. I‚Äôm nervous :( I‚Äôm worried since I took it on a empty stomach I will get sick. I also am worried that I will have a panic attack at some point today. 5mg is NOT a ‚Äútherapeutic dose‚Äù which means i‚Äôm not supposed to feel any effects from it BUT I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 90 pounds so I think I might! I‚Äôm easily effected by medication. Also, taking 5mg may be good if you have nerves about taking meds because it‚Äôs like a test run to see if you have any huge side effects. I watched those videos on youtube where people tell ‚Äútheir journey‚Äù and honestly they made me nervous but I think that to a extent it‚Äôs probably dramatized. Not taking away from anyone‚Äôs experience though! I will see for myself over the next couple of days, and when I go up to 10mg (if I do, I probably will). Nervous right now!

Dang health anxiety.,True,"F28 So I was putting wood in an old cast iron wood furnace that had debris on it from recent use, and I burned my arm. Skin ended up peeling off yesterday, the day after the burn, after taking a shower. And the fear all started when I looked up how to care for the burn and now it's spiraled.

What makes it worse is that the CDC says you should get a booster shot every 10 years because the immunity wears off, but the WHO says you don't need boosters as an adult so places like the UK only give vaccines to young children and folks who never got the vaccine.

I've had situations before where I got punctured by a rusty nail or staple on the floor (removed the carpeting and some staples were stubborn to come out of the hardwood floor), and I turned out just fine. So it's weird that I'm having this fear now and even weirder that booster shots are recommended in the US but not in the UK or some other countries. Makes things extra confusing and extra EXTRA anxiety inducing.

For the record, I got my full set of tetanus shots as a kid. They weren't as spaced out as they seem to be nowadays, last one I got was at the age of 5.

When I was in school I was in great shape, visible abs and felt attractive, confident to boot.

I got comfortable in a relationship and would sit on my xbox all night drinking coca cola and eating all sorts of rubbish and socially isolating.  As you can imagine when this relationship broke off, and I tried entering the world again, I had lost the spring in my step, I was overweight, unconfident and a shell of whom I used to be in school, and ever since that point I've really struggled finding myself.  (10 years ago). 

I'm not obese, but I'm very much not in good physical shape, I have flab everywhere and no visible muscle.  I've taken up boxing as a final hoorah to try and sort this out, but I've realised that on my days where I'm overtly hung up on how I feel/look, my anxiety is off the charts - when I feel like I'm making progress I'm genuinely quite happy and not as anxious.  I'm definitely not as confident as I once was, but it's really hard to be confident and outgoing when you hate who you have become physically. 

I just wonder if anybody else has gone through something similar, although I'm not massively overweight, something about not being in shape really destroys me mentally, I've been trying for years to get it sorted but always come up short and end up slacking.

This is a constant dilemma for me with large social gatherings. It's easier not going, and I don't think it'll be very fun. Also I'd have to battle bad traffic on the way home.

Normally people tend to fight it to avoid the physical and emotional symptoms it can bring:Tachycardia, breathlessness, chest pain etc. The best way to get rid of them is just flow through all the symptoms you can experience, do not escape, just breathe and feel them no matter how bad it gets, just resist while controlling your breath (5,5,5) The more you try to run or escape the longer anxiety will stay with you. Even if your mind tells you that you are going to die from a heart attack or a stroke just resist and do not fight, why? Because anxiety doesn‚Äôt exist, it‚Äôs all happening in your brain. How can you fight something that is not real? Using grounding and breathing techniques you can overcome it. I did it and I believe you will conquer this imaginary enemy!

During this crisis I have learned to come to terms with death and life, and that I got to make the most of my life since its short but its the longest thing I'll be experiencing.

10jxm6n,1674536285,Fixating on and analyzing TV shows/movies to the point of exhaustion. Anyone else?,True,"Only recently have I realized that this is a behavior probably attributed to my diagnosis, but I can't seem to find where anyone has discussed it. I'd love to hear if anyone has experienced something similar, what that has been like for them, and how they address any negative consequences of the behavior. 

Basically, when I watch a TV show, I have to commit to it fully. No phone usage or distractions while it's on in case I miss something. That portion is normal for much of the population, I can assume. Where it becomes problematic is after I turn a tv show off or end a movie. For hours or even days after watching an episode, I find my mind venturing to it several times an hour to analyze scenes, revisit them in my mind, and to some degree - disassociate into that movie or tv shows reality in a way that is very distracting and often uncomfortable. For instance, I will imagine what could have happened if characters  had acted differently or imagine conversations that may have taken place between the characters behind the scenes. I am a creative person and generally find enjoyment in thought-provoking questions like that, but I strongly dislike being unable to stop thinking about them for extended periods of time.  I've noticed that the more dramatic or suspenseful a movie is, the more often I will have these intrusive thoughts. Thus, I've always stayed away from horror movies and thrillers in general because I truly feel immersed in that world for long periods of time.

Well after almost 3 years of avoiding catching Covid, my fianc√© tested positive today. Out of the blue she started experiencing severe sinus issues and fever like side effects (aches, chills). We were together all weekend. As soon as she got the results of her test, I went into panic mode and haven‚Äôt snapped out of it. This has been going on for about 4 hours now. I‚Äôve never been more excited to get out of my residence and go to work in the morning (provided I‚Äôm symptom free). 

I‚Äôve accepted I will likely produce a positive test result in a few days. I think I‚Äôm just having some anticipatory anxiety about this likelihood.

1. I don't want people to treat me differently. There's a lot of stigma around it especially where I am and at my school (I am currently enrolled.) But at the same time, telling people and being an example is the only way we can break through that stigma
2. I don't want people to define me by my anxiety. I already have people refusing to see how much I've grown in the past few years. I feel like if I tell them they just won't see past the ""disorder"" part.
3. I don't want to sound selfish bringing it up unnaturally. 
4. I have trust issues, and want to get through the rest on my own. By the time I finally started therapy, my therapist just agreed that all the coping mechanisms I've found on my own are good. He didn't have anything else to tell me, which sucks but at least I can get through things by myself right?

10jvt82,1674530383,Waking up in the middle of the night unable to breathe for a few seconds...anxiety vs sleep disorder?,True,"Hello, I am a female in my mid 20s about 5'2 and about 112lbs. I've always struggled with anxiety and in the past few years it has gotten worse. For example, there are times i'll feel like I can't breathe very well or I'll have your classic anxiety attack/panic attack symptoms just randomly.

For the past few years, I've noticed that once in a while (like maybe 1x every month sometimes less or more than that) I will randomly wake up in the middle of the night and I'll realize that I can't breathe and at this point i'm like wide awake. It's like I'm not breathing and I am also unable to inhale for a few seconds and then I'll try to calm down and inhale little by little and then I'll be able to breathe again. My heart will be racing a bit because I just freaked out that i can't breathe for a few seconds but then it'll go back to normal. After that I'll just lay back down and go back to sleep. I usually always sleep on my back also and maybe that contributes to it?

My boyfriend says that I don't snore, and he thinks maybe it's the position of my pillow. However, I'm just worried that it could be something like sleep apnea. I know the best thing for me is to probably go and get a sleep study done (and probably also therapy lol) but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this?

10jvjhw,1674529534,DAE get shortness of Breath when Walking?,True,"Hello, I am 24F. I've been diagnosed with anxiety in 2020 after experiencing severe chest pain &amp; nausea and some other symptoms that eventually went away after a few months. 

I believe it was triggered again last year when I attempted to start a business, which is currently on hiatus. 

I've always been a bit anxious, but my condition worsened in December, during a very stressful time in my life. I temporarily lost a huge amount of money in the bank due to a glitch in their system (which was eventually returned to me), I was applying for a visa (which was a big deal to me), and was preparing for some year-end events. It all turned out fine but the process really put me on the edge. Right after I got my visa I noticed a feeling of lump in my throat that comes and goes. It made eating difficult. I had trouble sleeping (which was resolved by hydroxyzine). Then I almost fainted outside my home while walking due to shortness of breath. 

Right after this incident I started having anxiety attacks daily. Was confined in my home for 3 weeks. 

I had ecg, echo, full blood chemistry test (including troponin), urinalysis, chest x-ray, ct coronary angiogram of the heart, thyroid function test, cranial MRI, which all came back clear. The anxiety attacks are gone, but I still can't walk continuously or I'll get the SOB attack. 

I found a work around by stopping to rest whenever I need to go outside, but I can't go on like this as I have an international trip in less than two months. If this is indeed anxiety I don't want it to interfere with my dreams, but whenever I tried walking around the house (was hoping I could build tolerance) I would get the SOB that lasts 30 minutes.

DAE experienced the same thing? I'm just waiting for it to go away at this point, but sometimes it's very upsetting.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10jvjhw/dae_get_shortness_of_breath_when_walking/,Dry-Firefighter9042,

Then I went on a date last Saturday that I felt went well, but I was so anxious the whole time. I felt myself holding back from the date because I was so anxious. It was hard for me to even be affectionate, all I could think about was how impossible it would be to like me. Either way, the date kissed me and told me he had an amazing time and wanted to do something this upcoming weekend. I was so happy. 

Then, mid-conversation yesterday, he stopped talking to me. Completely gone. No explanation. I immediately started having a panic attack, one that hasn‚Äôt gone away since yesterday. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed that a date is what triggered it, but all I could think was ‚Äúyou messed this up‚Äù, ‚Äúyou must‚Äôve said something wrong‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe you weren‚Äôt attractive enough, or a good kisser‚Äù, etc. I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night, and all day today I‚Äôve been sweating, restless, and nauseous.

10jv8wf,1674528656,What are some things you do to control intrusive thoughts?,True,"Short backstory: I've struggled with anxiety for the majority of my life, and there were times when I could manage it better and other times when it became more difficult and started to affect my daily life. During the pandemic, that's when my anxiety manifested even more and it got harder to manage. However, I have been in therapy for 2 years now, and it has helped me tremendously, but recently it's always when I see things on my social media of violence (which is almost all the time) of any sort that my mind starts to spiral. I tried to change my fyp on tiktok or limited my time going on certain apps, but it somehow doesn't change my fyp and I'll get back-to-back violent videos that are from the news. I think this has triggered my anxiety because of the feeling of uncertainty of what might happen that I start fearing to even leave my house. Also right when I lay my head on my bed at night, that's when my mind goes all over the place and thinks of all the worst-case scenarios and so it keeps me up at night üò≠ My therapist recommended that I should try to do some self-talk and identify that it is ""anxiety"" and not an everyday reality, which has helped to an extent. 

Although that is one method that has helped, I wanted to know what are some other ways that has helped you control any intrusive thoughts and what you have found that has helped you in the short-term and long-term?

10jv2hd,1674528101,Anxiety Couple Days After Mixing Cannabis &amp; Alcohol,True,"Hello everyone,

I apologize in advance if this is posted in the wrong place.  Please direct me to a different place if it is wrong.

I want to post this as I'm dealing with some anxiety from my experience with cannabis and alcohol a couple days ago. And I'm hoping to find people that have also experienced something similar and wondering how they dealt with it.

My current plan is to see a psychiatrist to find of whether these thoughts will be with my for the rest of my life or if I'm just dealing with lingering effects of mixing cannabis &amp; alcohol.

**tl;dr ‚Äì Mixed cannabis &amp; alcohol. Had panic attacks that came in waves. With each panic attack, ad very intense suicidal thoughts &amp; thoughts of wanting to hurt others or vandalize. Also thoughts of wanting to run away and hopelessness as well. Now doing better but have mild anxiety and sometimes thoughts of harming others and hopelessness.**

A couple days ago, I decided to experiment cannabis with alcohol. I was feeling 8/10 drunk. I decided to take 2 tablets of 5mg Sativa tablets.  Last time I took marijuana was about 1 year ago. Last time I took Sativa, I took 20mg total and didn't mix with alcohol. It had no effect on me. But this time was different.

0200 ‚Äì I took the tablets.

0230 ‚Äì The giggles &amp; munchies started. Some objects were nice to touch. Normal high for me.

0300 ‚Äì I start puking.

0330 ‚Äì Things got terrible. I started to have thoughts of harming others. Couldn't focus. I actively had to think about self-control.

0400 ‚Äì My first wave of many panic attacks. Walked outside with my wife to hopefully take my mind off things. Instead, I started to freak out. My thoughts were: ""I have to run away,"" ""I want to hurt someone,"" ""I want to break something,"" ""I want to die."" It took everything in my body, mind, and soul to not act on any of these thoughts. Best thing I could do was pull at the moss/grass at a person's front lawn and roll the dirt in my hands. After about what seemed like 10 minutes of a panic attack, I was able to come to and felt I was myself again.

430 ‚Äì Another panic attack but this was 2x more intense than the other. This took everything in my being as well AND THEN SOME to not act on my thoughts. Suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, acts of vandalism, wanting to run away were all going through my head but stronger. The worst was the thoughts of hopelessness and despair. I just wanted it all to stop and had strong thoughts of just smashing my head. At this point, I yelled to my wife to call 9-1-1 because I was afraid I would do something terrible.

0500 ‚Äì Ambulance came and checked me out. They checked my vitals. Heart rate was 120 but mainly because I was anxious about the panic attacks. They eventually left and chalked it up to a bad time with marijuana.

0500 ‚Äì 1000 ‚Äì The rest of the morning, I kept going through waves of panic attacks but with less intensity and duration. Still terrible and barely manageable

Now ‚Äì I feel like I have this lingering mild anxiety. Mainly because I am terrified of the thoughts I had with my previous experience. I feel like I have occasional thoughts of harming others and thoughts of hopelessness. Right now, I feel confident I can stop from acting on my thoughts but definitely don't want to keep this unchecked.

Different faces on each day, always something unsettling, a absoulute *creep*.

*She‚Äôll* stay dormant in my room sometimes, and kindly leave me out of her games.

But most days *she* pulls up my walls and climbs in my skin.

So close I cant breath *she* holds me, pulls me in.

I remember one month breathing techniques would keep *her* away.

I miss those days.

Time passed and that didn‚Äôt work anymore so I‚Äôd run.

I would run on an incline of 6.7, but she still caught up to me when the treadmill turned off and I made my way home.

I tried to have all the friends over but she‚Äôd wait patiently in my room. Waiting, bubbling under the surface.

*She* hates when I drink, so I tend to do that until I get sick, but the next morning *she's* always such a vengeful bitch.

I keep her at bay with a new body sometimes, a few lays here or there.

But *she‚Äôll* still scratch at my walls until I let her in.

*She‚Äôs* active and forceful.

No way I can win.

So when *she* claws through my walls and into my soul I lay limp and I shutter while she eats me up whole

I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs easier to let her feast on me.

Break each rib puncture my skull and my **heart‚Ä¶‚Ä¶** my **heart** is what she wants most

It flutters and jumps when she gets too close,

so when it pounds and pounds I know she‚Äôs near,

for my bride is *anxiety* and *she‚Äôs* told me a secret and made it quite clear.

That it‚Äôs better to give in now and crawl into that hole, because *she‚Äôs* going to change and change until *it* devours my soul.

Today, I reached out to some for advice online on a topic that‚Äôs been confusing and sensitive to me for a while now, and before I even asked them I *knew* something would go wrong. I knew that asking online was not the best idea, but I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone else about it.

Sure enough, something went wrong. I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly what, but the first respond I got back wasn‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ nice. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it wasn‚Äôt really horrible or nasty either, but I‚Äôm so bad with criticism and confrontation that I immediately felt horrible and took the post down. 

Now all my brain is yelling at me is that I should never ask for advice ever again. I know it‚Äôs such an extreme reaction, but whenever anything happens like this (someone misunderstanding what I said, etc) my anxiety just tells me it‚Äôs better to pretty much never talk again. And I guess this time stings even more because I just thought I was getting a little better at telling myself that my anxiety isn‚Äôt right, and I do have a right to talk and ask for advice when I need it. Now I feel right back at the beginning. And part of me feels like I‚Äôm acting like such a child for having such an extreme reaction to one little comment.

10juh4n,1674526322,21M Anxious person here. Strange strip club experience + advice for anxiety/fear of intimacy appreciated,True,"Very Nsfw // TW: SA

TL;DR: I was awkward/creepy at the strip club. Part of me thinks I'm exaggerating but another part thinks that I really did fuck up. I think I adequately described everything so let me know what you think. 

I'd like to start by saying that I've been working through personal issues and trauma for the last few years that are responsible for me being so anxious. I also might be autistic? Had talks about it with my doctor when I was younger but my parents never did anything. Just thought I'd mention that. Oh and this isn't the first time something like this has happened (non strip club related). 

Anyways, I'll quickly explain why I'm making this post and what answers I'm looking for. 

I went to a strip club. It was my third time ever. Not a unique or out of place kind of thing for me jic that's important. I'm not naive about the services and intimacy involved either. I respect sex work and don't think the strippers are evil or misleading for flirting or whatever else. 

Anyways, basically I think that I may have made a stripper uncomfortable. I also think that because of the state of the economy that she may have ""pushed through"" the experience so that she wouldn't lose any money. 

I have my issues and I doubt myself a lot. I also know that there's likely nothing too bad here but I really can't shake it. So please let me know that I'm being crazy. Or maybe I did fuck up. Making people uncomfortable or being perceived as creepy/predatory is a major source of anxiety (more like slight obsession) for me and has to do with the issues and trauma I mentioned earlier. 

I went to a strip club and had two dances from the same stripper. This stripper and I met almost a year ago and we hadn't seen each other since then. We ""hit it off"" when we first met I'd say. We both were into politics and metal and talked a lot before any transactions. Even during the dances we still continued our conversations. 

She was also more ""open minded"" for a lack of better words, compared to the average stripper. She was all over me and she told me to touch her (except no ass, breasts, or genitals). I could be wrong and maybe strippers are like this more often than not. 

Anyways, I don't really go to strip clubs ever but I felt like it recently. I figured that the last stripper I met was so great that I'd go back to see her. Let's call her ""M"" for now. 

So I decide to call the strip club and ask if she was dancing that night since it's been almost a year since I last went. 

They tell me yes and so I start thinking of what I'm going to say and do when I get there. I go over the conversation I'll have with the bouncer and strippers and I try and think of every possible response they may have and how I'll react and etc.. I know it's not the healthiest thing to do. 

Anyways, I take a few hits of the zaza before going in to chill me out. This was likely a mistake and may have to do with why I'm doubting myself. But I mean I was no where near high. Maybe lightly buzzed. 

So I go in and pay and get frisked and as I turn to walk to the stage I see M standing in front of me a few feet away. She says hi and hugs me and asks how I've been. I tell her I've been fine and I don't hug her. I tell her that I don't want to hug her because my hands are freezing cold (they were). She said it doesn't matter but I kept my hands off. 

1st incident. Was this weird?? She kept hugging me for like 10 seconds after I said that and so I'm just standing there with my arms either at my sides or hovering around her. The image of me (6'0) standing there like that while this short, naked stripper hugged me made me paranoid. I thought the bouncers were gonna come talk to me and my mental script also started falling apart. So I got super anxious real quick. 

We talked a bit more and she leaves and I go to have a seat. She comes back quickly and sits on my lap and we talk. 

2nd Incident- I don't know what I was thinking. It must have been the za, my anxiety, and me trying to piece back together my script that made me say this but I told her halfway through our conversation something like ""I don't go to strip clubs often and the last dance I had from you was so great that I had to call and see if you still worked here"". 

Oh god I felt so fucking sick after that. Like uh-oh, now I'm some fucking loser that couldn't get his mind off two prior dances so I had to call and see if she still worked there. Like now I'm some guy who has this weird, one-sided connection with her. I'm not obsessed or anything. 

Some other strippers there aren't like M and are a bit more strict. Which is fine but I don't want to waste money figuring out who's strict and who isn't. I know that M isn't. And I know that she's cool. So I thought I'd ask if she still worked there. I should've kept that to myself. 

She doesn't react significantly. She says something like ""oh really? You like me that much?"" and I keep it cool and try shifting the conversation to something else. Then she asks what they said when I called to ask. This is where shit starts crumbling internally. I tell her that they did in fact confirm for me that she still worked there. 

I realize that she's probably looking at me a whole lot differently now. Now I'm some creep. Or now I'm some loser. Or now I'm a potential threat. I'm keeping up in conversation and being pleasant but inside I'm scrambling to find out what exactly she's thinking now and how to go about it. 

We talk more and everything is ""fine"" on the outside. We talk about what we've been up to and the midterms and other politics. 
I admit that the conversation was pleasant and she didn't give me any signs of being uncomfortable. But idk. I just have to accept that she likely did feel somewhat uncomfortable (like a 4/10?) and I have to keep working on what I say. 


Maybe 10-15m later I ask for a dance after she gets off stage. 

We talk before and after the dance about music and politics again. During the dance we mostly just let ourselves get into it and didn't talk too much unless it was dirty talk or whatever. She was rougher and doing more than last time too. 

After this I ask for a vip dance which is like 30 minutes. 
This is where shit hits the fan. 

We get into it and she's doing a lot more than the last time I got a vip dance. It's similar but now she's kissing me, rocking herself on my leg, rubbing my d***, and she's letting me kiss her almost everywhere. 

It's great and all but I immediately notice that she jerked away from me after I kissed her neck. I ask if it's still OK for me to kiss and she says yes. 

I kiss her stomach and inner thighs and she jerks away. I really do not want to take any chances at all and so I keep asking if everything's fine. She says yes but my anxiety keeps growing.

Then she makes a strange sound and jerks away AGAIN. I ask the same question and she gives me the same answer. But now I realize that she's likely repulsed by me and is only trying her best not to jump out of her skin. 

What if she's broke or an addict or something and she's just trying to get through this to get paid. And here I am understanding this and still continuing to put her through this. 

I really start losing it here. Like my worst fear came true and there's some part of me that probably knew what I was doing and kept going. 

I try and keep it cool because I know how I am and I analyze the situation again. So I keep my hands off as I think things over. 

M keeps gesturing to keep touching her but I don't. I'm trying to observe her body language and her dirty talk and it all seems fine but I assume that she's really good at being pleasant despite feeling the opposite. I decide to call it quits. 

Before I'm able to tell her that I'd like to end the dance, she pushes my face into her neck. 

I realize that she's actually more like shaking instead of jerking away. And the noises she's making are actually moans. Some just sounded weird I guess?? I ask one more time if everything's fine and she straight up tells me that it feels really good and that she knows what she's doing and that she wouldn't be all over me if she wasn't comfortable. 

So yeah.. that was embarrassing. I'm just stuck inside my head so much that I convinced myself she wasn't in to it. I felt like I was pulled out of some horror movie. Not the first time something like this has happened in my life. 

We still had like 20 minutes left so I took her word and relaxed and let loose. Then at the end she didn't even want to get off when the bouncer came in and told us our time was up. 

She also told me normal stripper lines like ""I love wrapping myself around you"", ""you're not an asshole like these other guys"", ""you make me feel so relaxed"", ""you're such a gentleman, I can let my guard down"". 

But everyone says that (which is fine, it's part of the job) and I just feel like the awkward incidents I had tainted me. Like she's lying because it's easier or better to just accept some weirdo's money in exchange for feeling uncomfortable for less than an hour. 

Why am I like this? Everything seems fucking fine but what if I'm right?? 

What if me mentioning how I called to ask about her and me not hugging her and standing there like a dumbass made her think like ""Oh there's something wrong with this guy. Oh no and now I have to take him as a customer."" 

Like even though all went ""well"" during the dances, she still could have perceived me as a weirdo who she has to get through. And she'd also be right about me too. There is something wrong with me. 

Ever since I left the club I just couldn't shake the feeling that I did do wrong. I convinced myself that everything was fine despite understanding very well that she likely was put off by me. 

The evidence is clear. I did something to make her uncomfortable, she plays it off, and I selfishly let myself calm down like if everything's OK. 

I should have ended the dance. Even if I'm wrong I should have ended it just to be safe. There's no way for to me confirm how she felt but I know better than to believe that everything's OK after I do some weird shit. 

I don't know myself. What exactly did I look and sound like when this was happening? She acted like I wasn't freaking the fuck out. To be honest I've devoted more time to learning how to fake emotion than learning how to appropriately express it. 

I hate this. Even when I'm in the moment and able to control my anxiety and thoughts, I still end up heavily doubting myself afterward. 

I'm just so tired of this. I don't want to try anymore. I just want to be fixed or discarded. No inbetween anymore. 

Does anyone here have serious anxiety over intimacy and romance? Like as in being so anxious because you think you're making the other person uncomfortable and being perceived as malicious? Even with people I know well and want to be intimate with (not talking strippers), and who want to be intimate with me, I still can't be at ease and I feel like every little thing I do might accidentally do harm.

I (29F) had a really shitty start to the year lol I had a bunch of car issues right on New Year's Eve and totaled up 400+ dollars to get it running until I get a new - used car. Then work had a bumpy start to the year due to things outside of my control but I had to deal with that (the last 2 weeks have been horrible and my stress is so high right now when usually it's so-so.

I had my new year pretty much planned out and ready to kick ass and move on from the last 3 years of the pandemic! Then this happened and it just feels like a kick to my stomach because my anxiety causes me to be tired (b/c I'm in this state of panic ) and not want to be productive/motivated/etc until I ""calm down"". I'm a perfectionist also so when things don't go right it's hard to get out of the mindset of ""OMG I RUINED IT MY YEAR IS RUIN AA"" even though I try to be realistic (obviously anxiety hates reality lol).

I'm trying to build a time-blocking schedule so I can just fall onto that when the stress is too overwhelming and I can't think/make decisions. However, I still have this habit of just throwing everything to the side until I feel less stressed/anxious but then that's like...a week/two weeks wasted! I hate it!

Does anyone have any tips on how to combat this way of thinking? 

So far: I'm doing research into meditation (with mixed results since I end up daydreaming and getting distracted lol) and I'm fixing my diet with more water to make me feel more energized.

I keep having nightmares that my husband is leaving me or cheating on me. I wake up from these dreams in a sweat, with wet eyes, labored breathing, and a ton of anxiety. They rob me of sleep, because I can‚Äôt fall back asleep after them.They leave me anxious all day, replaying the very realistic images of him loving someone else in my head. 

In the one I just woke up from, my husband asked me to be polyamorous. I went along with it and he quickly became involved a woman, while I didn‚Äôt seek other relationships. He asked her to marry him and sent her pictures of us together, saying ‚Äúthis is my other wife.‚Äù She started bashing me and said his eyes looked empty and that he‚Äôs clearly not happy with me, so he should just divorce me and marry her. That he wouldn‚Äôt have sought out a relationship with her if ours was truly healthy and fulfilling. She said I don‚Äôt offer him anything, she‚Äôs better at sex, more attractive, etc.   I was so upset that I began trying to hurt myself (in the dream).

The thing is, these dreams aren‚Äôt rooted in reality at all. My husband and I have a very healthy relationship. He shows me every day how much he loves me. And in the case of this most recent dream, it‚Äôs a scenario that would never happen because upon a friend of ours starting a polyamorous relationship, my husband and I have discussed how polyamory is definitely not for us.

I try not to tell him about the dreams because they are frequent enough that it is very upsetting to him. But most of the time I‚Äôm visibly anxious and when he asks for a reason, I‚Äôll tell him I had a nightmare. He‚Äôll ask ‚Äúdid I cheat on you in that dream?‚Äù And I‚Äôll say yes, and he‚Äôll just shake his head and look a little defeated. I fear that he‚Äôll get tired of hearing about it and it‚Äôll push him away.

Hi, I'm in psychiatry right now for GAD, panic disorder and emetophobia (maybe depression too, depending on who you ask). I got prescribed mirtazapine 7.5mg for anxiety to be taken at night, and recently I've been playing drums with a band live which is a huge step for me.

Recently my medication got upped to 15mg (I also take buspirone, but this was unchanged) and I've been noticing that my last gig and the last few days in general have been super anxiety ridden. I've had two actual panic attacks after not having any for weeks, even through gigs. 

First of all, is this normal? Has anyone else ever taken this medication with this experience? I can't find much information regarding this. Also, since I can't get medical advice tonight, is it a stupid idea to take none tonight and then 7.5mg again tomorrow instead? It feels like I'd be back to what I normally have then, right?

Ever since I'd say October I started having chest pain and I the worst freak out. I honestly thought I was having a heart attack. I ended up going to the doctor and she diagnosed me with inflammation in my chest wall due to all the lifting and pulling I've been doing for the past 11 years as a CNA. It comes and goes and she says it can take days/months or even years to clear up bc I'm still currently doing the same job. I then again kept having the pain even though I knew what it was I went to the Emergency room a total of two separate times since October to now and they did EKG/blood work and chest X-rays and pretty much told me it's not my heart. But still my anxiety will not allow me to accept that. I wish it would.

I‚Äôm starting to realize I probably have at least mild social anxiety, and also think I have rejection sensitivity dysphoria. I thought this might be the best place to get some information. I am starting to look for a therapist which may help me figure out what‚Äôs wrong. From the research I‚Äôve done, I have most of the symptoms of RSD, but I obviously don‚Äôt have the ability to diagnose myself.

From a post I made in another sub about my mental health I described how I make myself think that most of my close friends are only friends with me because we have mutual close friends; not only that but that they actually dislike me. In their comment on my post, someone explained that their daughter had a similar mentality and that it was called RSD.

For context, I moved across the country to my current town this past summer (which I am happy about). Made some amazing friends pretty quick and they introduced me to their friend circle. So now I have a best friend and a number of good friends. 

However, I often take anything that isn‚Äôt positive and spin it so that I think they don‚Äôt actually like me. For example, I‚Äôll send a friend a snap and he‚Äôll respond a few hours later; I immediately get anxious that he doesn‚Äôt actually enjoy talking to me. Things like that.

It‚Äôs gotten so bad that a few days ago when I went out with some of these friends, we were gonna pick someone else up. We called him and two other friends in the car spoke to him, but I didn‚Äôt speak because I thought he might not come with us if he knew I was there.

For starters my (23M) gf (24F) has no diagnosis of anxiety, but her dad has already had a panic attack before and both him and her sister are on meds for it. We are looking for a psychologist after a long time of convincing but nothing yet.

Onto the story, today I suggested to my GF that she get an IUD. As far as I know her, she complains about headaches. Since she‚Äôs on contraceptive pills and I know how much they can affect one‚Äôs body I thought it could be a good option.

Well, while searching for more information I saw that the hormonal IUD has more efficiency (99,8%) than the tubal ligation (99,5%) ‚Äî if my numbers are incorrect feel free to correct me.

The thing is, when we have sex she doesn‚Äôt feel safe enough to just use the pills as she says they have a big margin of error and even though I disagree, her body her choices. Since I‚Äôm circumcised, I don‚Äôt really like condoms but I use it because she‚Äôs the one with the uterus after all.

When I saw that the IUD has a higher efficiency I thought ‚Äúwell jackpot, 3 birds and one stone‚Äù. Then, she instantly put the idea down. I said that we‚Äôd talk to a gynecologist, do everything right but no, just no, she doesn‚Äôt feel safe using it as the only contraception method and that we‚Äôd have to use a condom.

So, I started to get impatient because it was getting irrational for me, she doesn‚Äôt even know why she doesn‚Äôt feel safe and why she feels anxious about it.

Then, here I think I was an asshole because I said ‚Äúno contraceptive will ever be enough‚Äù ‚Äùyou can‚Äôt put everything on anxiety, there‚Äôs a reason you feel like that but you go for the simple answer‚Äù.

10joxhe,1674511407,I am truly really frightened because HIV transmission because of sucking nipples for 6 minutes,True," 

Hi everybody,

I am so scared and frightened about a possible HIV infection. English isn't my native language, so sorry in advance.

So one week ago I had sex with this thais (from thailand) woman, who I later found out is a sexworker/prostitute. Luckily, the sex was complety safe. We had sex with a condom on the whole session, and she didn't gave me a blowjob. I didn't notice any tears or failure of the condom. She only touched an stroked my dick with her hands to make me hard and to put the condom on my dick.

But the reason why I am scared is: we had some foreplay! And during this foreplay I sucked her nipples. I don't know exactly how long I sucked her nipples, but I think between 4 - 6 minutes. I had 2 wounds in my mouth (and maybe an additionel one on my lip, so that would make 3). The thing is, I read that HIV can also be in breastmilk. So is it possible that while I was sucking her nipples, maybe some milk came in my mouth were I have the wounds and that is how HIV is transmissed to me? I didn't taste any milk from what I can remember and I don't know if she is lactating or if she has milk in her breast (producing breast milk)? I am so scared right now! I am so, so stupid!! I will get myself tested but I am so, so scared and frightened!

I don't know her HIV status! The only thing I know for sure is that she is a prostitute, from Thailand, who works independent, and goes to thailand frequently (when I met her she was not so long ago back from a long time in thailand).

She also is 31 years old.  
I asked her: I was just wondering, if you have any kids (give birth/have been pregnant)?

So, basically, I met two girls from an exchange student program. I was striking up a conversation with them, everything went okay except for the fact that I literally *shook*. Like trembling. My two friends pointed this out to me when the girls left. I feel so exposed! I have severe anxiety but I thought I was good at keeping it to myself. Apparently it's obvious that you're anxious to other people...Like I already feel terrible, but others *knowing* that I feel unwell...I hate it. Why does my anxiety have to show? Ugh.

10jlrp5,1674503792,I am at a crossroads.,True," 

When I was 21 and about to graduate from college a mexican career advisor at my school's employment office told me that they did not welcome or give jobs to women like me, as she laughed about it with another person of her race who also came into the office for career assistance. As a result, after I got pregnant by a guy who turned out to be loser, I did not dare go back for mental health concerns, and ended up working as a very demeaning job that exposed me to a lot of societal ill treatment and experienced daily sexual harassment from my managers to the point that I felt mentally ill thinking about going to work. Being singled out in that city because I did not belong I was also never able to get paycheck stubs to get into my own place and lived out of drug intoxicated hotel rooms from the age of 23 to 25 to the point that I got high. Now I am 26 years old, I had saved up a lot of money from my job but I ended up wasting it on an unforgetabble expereince of traveling the US at 25 because nobody back in the border town that I moved to from Houston treated me right, there wasn't any entertainment outside of sketchy bars that I could find, and I was never meeting quality people to hang out with. Later on I found out that a person I leaned on for social support, also befriended other girls where I worked at and gave them all of my high valued secrets while they laughed about my pain, so they could improve their lives and persona, and have higher personal goals, including taking them out to the establishments that I would have killed to know about to save my mental health. I am not making enough right now and I am going back to school for a two year math and science degree that is highly competitive for entrance into a professional program, but the pain of having endured so much while I tried my hardest to work, settle down in my own place, and advocate for myself, while ending back up in square one is killing me. Any encouraging works are appreciated.

I work in insurance and a customer called saying that he had a letter from the DVLA saying that he is not insured even though he had a letter from us saying that the policy will auto renew. I looked at the notes and there was a note from a couple of months ago saying that he opted out of automatic renewal and I said that is why it never renewed. As soon as I said this he kicked off, shouting at me saying that I was calling him a liar because he was adamant that he never told us that. I then remembered that there was a previous issue where there was a small number of letters with the renewal invites we sent out saying that the policy will renew automatically, even if they did opt out. I get his frustration and admitted that the letter was misleading and apologised for this and that the letter was corrected a couple of months ago.

We are a very small team and my manager was off sick and there are certain things that my manager can do on the system that the rest of us can't. He wanted me to reinstate the policy and I explained that it is impossible for me to do this because I haven't got permission on my system to reinstate a policy that expired last year. I set up a quote for a new policy for him and it increased in price and he wanted me to match it down to the price the renewal was, which again, something I couldn't do as I can only waive out money up to a certain amount. The call was after 5pm which is when most people finish so I could not send it to anyone else to get an immediate response.

He said that we did not send out any letters saying that policy expired but I could see that we did send him a letter saying that the policy did expire but apparently he did not get that. He wanted a response straight away and there was literally nothing that I could do. He wanted to know what his options were, so I said that he can take out the new policy or he can go on comparison websites to see if there are any policies that may be more competitive just so that he is insured, and I can raise a complaint and my manager can call him tomorrow to discuss it further to see if we can reinstate or offer compensation etc. He then said I was calling him stupid because everybody knows about comparison websites and that won't help him as he wants our policy. I had to listen to him scream, shout and swear at me for about 20 minutes before he hung up.

I really do understand his frustration and it was an error that our company made, but made hands were tied. I wasn't anxious until after the call. I am dreading going back to work tomorrow because I keep thinking that maybe there was something more I could have done to help him and that the complaint will go against me.

10jk1nl,1674499629,The Importance of Mental Health in Overall Wellness,True," Ignoring or neglecting mental health can lead to a host of negative  consequences, including increased stress, anxiety, depression, and even  physical health issues. It's crucial that we prioritize mental health  and make it a priority in our daily lives. This can include practicing  self-care, seeking therapy or counseling, and talking openly about  mental health with friends, family, and loved ones. By placing  importance on mental health, we can create a more balanced and  fulfilling life for ourselves and those around us.

1. Mental health is closely linked to overall physical health: Studies have shown that people with poor mental health are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity.
2. Workplace productivity is affected by mental health: poor mental health can lead to absenteeism, presenteeism and staff turnover which can affect the productivity of a company.
3. Investing in mental health can be cost-effective: Early intervention and treatment for mental health can save money in the long run, as untreated mental health conditions can lead to more severe and costly problems in the future.

Lately, I have the most terrible sense of impending doom constantly. Always afraid that I have some life threatening condition. Always at the doctors or ER, getting bloodwork, xrays, and other tests done. 

I have been to the ER about 5 times this year alone. They have told me every time that I am healthy, or its something minor, like dehydration or a possible stomach bug.

I also suffer from Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome that is triggered by my anxiety (or from not eating, because of my anxiety) and makes me horribly physically ill sometimes... Which, in turn, causes me to think I am definitely at death's door.

I am a mental wreck right now... I am out of my anxiety and blood pressure medications because I didn't have my current insurance card at my last doctors visit..

For context: Health anxiety was never such a big concern of mine. Got doppler scans, holter, pressure, blood, liver; everything is fine. One moment or the other I think I‚Äôm dying or about to have a stroke/cardiac event. My throat gets tight. I feel that my face goes numb. A slight pressure on my left pectoral muscle is a guaranteed event. Went for a 3.5 km jog, checked my heart: 161 (which is admittedly, pretty high). That sent me into a spiral where I was absolutely sure I was dying. (Now it‚Äôs resting 60, I‚Äôm pretty active, I was in no actual danger being in that zone while jogging, I think).

So I came back and checked every 5 minutes, unsurprisingly, my heart took an hour to relax. I basically asked her to talk and told her that no, I‚Äôm not ok and that I cannot enjoy my moments with her, which only gives me more anxiety. That any little thing is taken as an an absolute certain sign that something is wrong. That I hate to feel like this and cannot for the life of me find a way to make it better.

She was very supportive, she listened and reassured me, and encouraged me to finally start therapy (I‚Äôve been putting this off, I‚Äôve been on meds before and that was a bittersweet experience, I would not go on benzos again). I started meditating again, but as we all know that is a very long term plan.

I feel good that I stopped hiding my anxiety. I felt better after talking to her, but I cannot use her as a permanent crutch. I just want to find a long term effective way to manage this.

I was anxiety free for 3 years. I've felt it from time to time, but I've even been able to travel the world alone. Two months ago I met a really nice girl and we started dating. In the beginning everything was great until one little thought changed everything: ""What if the fear comes back when she's with me?!"". There it was... It all went wrong ever since... I knew I didn't want to get into avoidance behavior and so I met her anyway. One day we were sitting on the couch and I felt panic set in. I could stop it by distracting myself. After that I never panicked again. Tomorrow we'll see each other again after two weeks and my self-esteem is gone. I want to see her so badly, but I'm so afraid of getting an anxiety attack.

I know I have to tell her how I feel. Otherwise I will not feel any better. The problem: She's a psychologist and I spoke to her about my anxiety and how I overcame it 3 years ago... I was way too self confident and now it's all coming back ""because of her"". I'm afraid she'll lose interest if I tell her...

We've been engaged for over a year. I have generalized anxiety disorder. I take medication for it, which helps a lot, and I am in therapy (although the frequency has been reduced because my insurance coverage ran out). 

I DO trust my partner. I really, really do. But I always have this ""what if"" anxiety voice inside my head. ""what if he randomly leaves you?"", ""what if he changes his mind about something?"", ""what if I am forcing him into marrying me and he doesn't really want to?"". And this anxiety is really loud and annoying, so I listen to it. And then I ask him for reassurance. The reassurance has definitely decreased overtime, which is awesome. But this really makes my partner sad whenever I ask for reassurance. 

Last night we were talk about making a will. And he said ""if we have kids, everything will first go to them"". We've talked A LOT about kids and both agree we really want them in the next couple years. So the fact that he said ""if"" really got my anxiety going. I mentioned him this and he said ""I meant if we have kids at the time that we die. Like if we die tomorrow, our stuff is obviously not going to our kids because we don't have any right now"". Which makes total sense now, but when he said it I didn't even think about that. I just focused on the ""if"". He then said ""how can we be getting married in weeks and you still don't trust me? I want you to always assume I have the best intentions"". It KILLS me when he says this.

10j9pdi,1674471038,Basic principles to master the graphic designing skill,True,"Do you think logo designing is simple? You should reconsider your thoughts. Logo designing is more than just design, and it is crafting a brand's identity because it is a brand's first impression. Customer's first brand's perception is very important as it influences the purchase decision and attitude towards a company or a product.¬†

Creative [**logo designer in Mumbai**](https://www.logodesignartistmumbai.com/logo-designer-company-services-mumbai.html) is in high demand. To help beginners who are about to start their journey as graphic designers, we have listed some tips to create a great logo design.¬†

**Be unique and creative**

The first and foremost thing required for a great designer is creativity. Designing an exclusive logo that can distinguish it from its competitors can make a brand stand out from the crowd. What is more significant is to create something different from anything already prevailing. Designing an exclusive logo is not about only avoiding limitation but also coming up with something that is an out-of-the-box. For instance, an Audi logo is not a car, or Apple's logo is not a mobile or computer.¬†

**Colour Scheme**

When considering a brand's personality, you should think about every factor of the image. Bold and bright colours may attract the viewer's attention, but at times it can also seem brash. Neutral or muted tones can exude sophistication, but in several instances, it can be overlooked. Designers should understand that every colour has various implications and can convey your brand message through shades. Every colour shade has a characteristic, so it is essential to find a balance between quirky and simple.¬†

**Listed below are some common colours and their characteristics**¬†

Red: Bold, Energetic

Green: Organic, Growth, and Instructional¬†

Orange: Friendly, Youthful¬†

Blue: Professional, Medical, Trustworthy¬†¬†

Pink: Fun¬†

Black: Powerful

Brown: Historical, Earthy

White: Pure, Clean, and Simple

Visual Double Entendre

Visual Double Entendre is a popular technique for logo designing utilized by most of the branding agency. In simple terms, it means that two images are wrapped into one with the wise interpretation of an idea, theme, or concept.¬†

**Keep it simple**

People should understand the message of the logo at first glance. With too many colours or complex shapes and confusing fonts of the logo, it will convey a wrong message to the viewers.¬†

**Make It Scalable**

Another great quality of an impressive logo is its scalability. Remember that your brand logo design will feature various types of advertisements, so the logo should look great on all the media. When the logo is scaled up on a billboard to a larger proportion, the logo should look great.

Now forgive me if this is the wrong place to post, I am not Reddit savvy. I'll try to make this quick. If you have experience with stress caused pain, please read on.

I was an alcoholic for many years (maybe 6), eventually I stopped drinking but was lucky enough to become a hypochondriac. For maybe four years I had my fair share of anxiety, panic attacks, etc. So much so it has gotten to the point that I became so stressed out that my blood pressure is/was reaching 150 over 80, when laying down. I do have physical pain which is a burning on the right side of my body/chest. When I have the burning, I have high blood pressure. I was getting pretty good at managing the ""episodes"" when I woke up one morning and chose to go for an intense run because I was ""done"" with anxiety and stress. This, coupled with an intense adventure in some extremely cold weather, has sent my body‚Äôs stress levels through the roof. Due to the pain being too much for me to handle, I visited many doctors, all saying high blood pressure is fine, it's only temporary, and to calm down. 

 

I eventually met a doctor that prescribed me Xanax to handle my stress. The Xanax works great when it works. But once it wears off, my body is in just as much pain as it was before I took the Xanax; almost like a switch. For some reason I don't think I need Xanax (my anxiety is pretty controlled at this point in my life) but the physical pain that has come from the amount of stress I have put it in is unbearable at times, which leads to some anxiety. 

 

Is there anyone experienced in physical stress symptoms and possibly the consumption of Xanax? My doctor suggesting taking half a Xanax (.2 mg) in the morning and half at night. I think I should simply take pain killers, but sadly I've got to wait to see him, so I thought I would do a wee bit of research until then.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j8xz6/xanax_for_stressanxiety/,ZhongShann,

10j7cjz,1674461225,Are you an introvert with anxiety?,True,"Anxiety. That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen. Life-saving when we are genuinely threatened, damaging when we become constantly anxious: anxiety is tiring ‚Äì it is meant to be. We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods. When prolonged, it isn‚Äôt just tiring ‚Äì it is exhausting. Sound familiar?

Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We prefer to re-charge on our own. We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts. We tend to have small, close-knit, social lives it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre anti-social!

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don‚Äôt have to be an introvert to struggle with it. Many introverts deal with anxiety, though, so this is quite common.

Here are the key signs you‚Äôre an introvert with anxiety:

¬∑ You‚Äôre more prepared than most others because you‚Äôve already thought through the worst-case scenarios.

¬∑ You have a tendency to over-think things and pay too much attention to your negative self-talk.

¬∑ You feel you always have to be doing something ‚Äì being busy (which is often different from being effective) may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety.

¬∑ You tend to prefer routines to novel situations. While this can be fine for periods, boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin.

¬∑ You‚Äôre often nervous without showing it ‚Äì many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism.

¬∑ You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are - anxiety primes us for the fight, flight, freeze response making us more likely to over-react to a low-risk situation.

¬∑ You have tendencies towards perfectionism. This is often allied to beliefs such as ‚ÄòI need to please everyone‚Äô, ‚ÄòI need everyone to like me to be a worthy person‚Äô.

¬∑ Nervousness can throw your chatter in to over-drive: while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say (and you‚Äôre normally sure of your facts before speaking), nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to over-compensate.

¬∑ You often have trouble sleeping ‚Äì either getting to sleep a-tall, waking through the night or waking way too early

Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard. Thankfully there is help at hand. Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with.

10j729u,1674460077,(TW: Discussion of the concept of death) Novel worries about being realities of being human/thanatophobia,True,"I'm only 20(M), but I've recently grown fear my future death so intensely that I've also grown to hate my humanity. (context: I have OCD but am being treated(both medically and via therapy) for it; my treatment works quite well other than in moments like these) Apologies for typos, this is being written *very* late at night for me but I'll put a TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, I've been obsessing over the very concept of death/dying. I feel like I have a ticking clock over my shoulders, counting down the seconds until my death. It's not like I have any terminal illness or anything... I (knock on wood) likely have decades before I die. However, anytime I'm doing something my mind feels is ""unproductive"", as in not propelling me towards something that will give my life further satisfaction, I'm letting the time just slip away, letting those sands in the hourglass falling into the void, with absolutely no chance of recovering them; hell, I even feel that way right now as I write this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if what I'm doing is ""unproductive"" in my mind's eyes, what *would be* productive? What furthers me towards the satisfaction that I'm craving? My fears don't surround the potential pain of my future death itself, rather the worry of whether or not I will be satisfied when it comes; when I'm on my deathbed, will I be satisfied with the outcome of my life? Or will I refuse to accept the inevitable, as I'm doing now, and try to fight the reaper to get out of bed? But what can help me get towards this satisfaction and what is it, exactly? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anytime I've ever asked someone about the purpose of life and what gives them satisfaction in it, I get different answers. My mother once told me, ""The purpose of life is to love each other"". But, *why*? How does the feeling of love among people give life its meaning? Before you tell me to go touch grass, I love my family and have been in love before, but I still don't understand how that justifies the acceptance of death? Others have told me similar, such as ""The purpose of life is to make each other happy"". When I was little, I always thought that the purpose of my life would be to change the world for the better. However, as I still hope to do that, I can't help but question why. Why does it matter if I attempt to change the world, if it'll have the same result anyway? Say I can, and I solve some huge problem with our society. What does that matter if I fixed some inane problem for some inane species on one of the near-infinite planets in the universe? Obviously, that's just nihilism, which I've never subscribed to, since that also involves the abandonment of morals, which I disagree with but now as I write this I still don't know why. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it's not like I'm a basement dweller or something; I'm a dual major at a big university in the U.S, with plenty of bright future prospects and a jam-packed extracurricular life. *So what's the deal with this meaning?* 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, that's a *way* bigger issue than one guy can solve on my own. Hell, philosophers spend their whole lives trying to figure it out, but I don't want to wait that long. *I'm running out of time here!*

&amp;#x200B;

And this is the point where it gets a lot more irrational. If I'm running out of time, and those sands are slipping away, I can't afford to wait to find out what to work towards. I need to know *now*. Even if I do find out *right this second*, I will still have to deal with all the limitations I already have, simply being a human. Like, a large portion of that time will be spent sleeping, for example. That's so much time wasted! After that, eating. After that, hygiene. Why do I have to do these things? Why do I need rest? Why do I get hungry? Why do I get dirty? Hell, why do I get sick and hurt? Why do I need to relax? Common leisure activities, i.e. watching a movie, wastes so much time! I can't get any of that time back! Why can't I just go forever until I'm satisfied with my life? Hell, why should I have to die at all? Also, if being human means being imperfect, why can't I just forsake my humanity entirely and just be completely flawless? I was always taught that life would be boring if I was perfect, but, *why?*

&amp;#x200B;

These worries are starting to affect my day-to-day. For example, I have a *drastically* shorter attention span, since doing things for longer periods of time feels like a waste. How could people be content with all of this wasted time? What could possibly allow them to feel fulfilled doing that? Why does life need balance? Why can't I just unilaterally work towards something that will satisfy me and make this fear go away? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this can be a driving factor among religions; that is, to theorize/figure out what happens after we do, eventually, die, to make it easier to accept. But I'm not very religious, so I don't get that cushion. I had a passing thought on this: ""*Well, if you do need that comfort, why don't you just try to be more religious?""*. But obviously that would be disingenuous. (side note: I'm not calling those who *are* religious dumb. I genuinely don't know what to believe.) I can't just *suddenly believe* in the concept of heaven so that I can be as pious of a person as I possibly can in order to get there. By that point, would it even be worth it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Mark Twain once said, ""I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.‚Äù, and used this philosophy to conquer this fear. But how does it explain why I'm alive *right now*? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be talking to my therapist about this, *obviously*, but I don't have an appointment for a bit but needed to get this off of my chest. Has anyone experienced similar? If so, what helped you conquer it? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: As a 20(M) college student with no reason to believe my death is anytime soon, I'm terrified I won't be able to achieve some arbitrary meaning that I need to accomplish by the end of my life. The more I ponder, I not only refuse to accept it, but I refuse to accept the fundamental parts of being human, i.e. biological stuff. As I wait for my next therapy appointment to discuss with a professional, anyone got any thoughts?**",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j729u/tw_discussion_of_the_concept_of_death_novel/,joshuaebalan,

Then, classes started and it got hard again. I have an issue managing to get to the bathroom because there are always people in the hall and in the lounge next to the bathroom, and my anxiety is extremely bad when I see them because even though I know everyone uses the bathroom I get very embarrassed and uncomfortable about someone knowing that that is what I am about to do. Lately in the last few weeks, I was almost never able to use the bathroom but i couldn't keep holding it bc I am very concerned about getting a UTI so I started walking 15 min away from my dorm to get to my place of work and use that bathroom. Today I drank a coffee to keep me up so I could finish my work and I forgot that it would make me have to pee. It was 9pm and my place of work was closed. I was already in my pajamas which is also a think that gives me anxiety (in that I can't let people see me with my pajamas on). I needed to pee and I really didn't think I had much of a choice, so I peed in a plastic container and will no have to wait until the morning to throw it away. I feel absolutely disgusting for feeling like I had to do this but this is definitely my breaking point because I cannot continue to live like this.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j50ey/ive_reached_my_breaking_point/,Old-Mood6364,
10j4td9,1674451618,Anxiety attacks,True,"TW FOR FEAR OF DEATH

Ever since I was little, I would have panic attacks about death. Not the thought of actually dying, but the idea that whatever happens after we die is permanent and lasts forever. Whether it‚Äôs a black void of nothing or some sort of spiritual afterlife, the thought of it causes me to have an anxiety attack. And it‚Äôs one of those things that over the years has gotten worse. I had found thoughts that had helped sooth it, but as I have gotten older, those thoughts stopped working. This used to be a nightly thing, but after I went on birth control, the panic attacks stopped and I didn‚Äôt think about this fear for over a year. But then, I stopped taking birth control and over time it came back. It went from every once in a while I would panic about it to just on my period and now it‚Äôs every night. I‚Äôm fine all day and then the second I get into bed the thoughts start. I overthink and I begin to panic and I can‚Äôt get the feeling or the thoughts out of my head. I went back on birth control but it has been an absolute nightmare getting my body readjusted, so the anxiety just continues. I have not found a single solution or coping mechanism that works and I am begging for anything that can help calm my fear because it gives me such a crippling anxiety that I can‚Äôt sleep until past 12 AM.

10j4pl3,1674451246,Panic attack over reading side effects on my antibiotic,True,"So I have major health anxiety and I‚Äôm in therapy and actively working on it with Cognitive behavioral therapy and medication. But I got a cut that got infected and was put on antibiotics. Well I noticed it was kind of making me get headaches and get dizzy so I looked up the side effects like an idiot.

And things come up like yeah it can cause dizziness and headaches‚Ä¶which sometimes causes blindness from pseudotumor cerbi. So I look that up and what are the symptoms just freaking headaches and dizziness and vision stuff- while I‚Äôm already got bad eyesight and my sinus pressure gives me headaches from weather changes. So what if I am getting this and I can‚Äôt tell and then it‚Äôs too late and I go blind?! 

And then other ones listed was C Diff and freaking lupus!! And now I‚Äôm crying and wishing I didn‚Äôt even take this medicine but the other other antibiotic for my infection I‚Äôm allergic too (bc this other antibiotic is what CAUSED my health anxiety bc I had a severe reaction). 

And just terrified I‚Äôm going to go blind or get C Diff or something. And with the blindness they say if it‚Äôs not handled early and promptly it can‚Äôt be fixed even if you go off the medicine and the condition with the pseudotumor that caused the blindness will be chronic. 

But like I googled the medicine and tons of people are prescribed it for acne and are fine besides getting headaches and are on it for months while I‚Äôm just on for ten days.

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking it‚Äôs happening because my eyes hurt really bad but it also snowed today and I didn‚Äôt sleep so it‚Äôs like is it the medicine or is it something else or is a normal freaking headache",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j4pl3/panic_attack_over_reading_side_effects_on_my/,WillowKings,

10j43bt,1674449177,Is it normal for my anxiety meds to make me want to sleep and dream all day? My dreams are staying with me in a new way‚Ä¶,True,"Some quick background; So, am in my mid 30s and was recently diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. I was also told I have late PPD even though my twins are 2.5 now (but I think that‚Äôs mostly blown over). I am
A stay at home mom. 

I am on my 3rd antidepressant prescription brand/option as the fist one made me gain weight a lot and the 2nd gave me other side effects. 

I have been on my current med/dosage for about 6 weeks now. I definitely feel less anxious and more level, so that‚Äôs clearly good. But, I‚Äôm also always wanting to go to bed/sleep. I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say I‚Äôm always exhausted‚Ä¶ more that I don‚Äôt want to do anything but sleep? I have always had dreams that are highly anxious and stressful. I never realized this till I noticed over the last few weeks my dreams are significantly less so. In some I actually feel confident. Some are very pleasant or entertaining. And I feel my dreams that night kinda flavor my day for the rest of the day. They kinda linger. I am a stay at home mom, so it‚Äôs not like I have a ton of mental workload to occupy my brain honestly. I don‚Äôt mind this, it‚Äôs just noticeable and noteworthy. 

So when my kids take a nap, I get myself a nap as quickly as possible. When my husband steps in to takeover to feed them dinner, I nap. As soon as I‚Äôm done with what I have to get done in the evening, I‚Äôm back to bed. It‚Äôs more of a craving to sleep than exactly being really tired. That‚Äôs the only way I can describe it. I plan my day in anticipation of my next sleep. I do everything I can to maximize sleep. On the weekends when my husband steps in more I go to bed early and sleep in late - sometimes 12 hours straight. 

I shared this with my dr and she said that maybe my brain is basically enjoying it‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúplay‚Äù and dream without the pressures of anxiety present. I kinda look at that as a hangover response from intense anxiety/stress for so long, maybe? So if she is right than my brain is just craving it‚Äôs time to dream and shut off reality, so it‚Äôs driving me to want to sleep. She suggested we give it a couple more months to see how it goes before discussing any potential changes to my meds. 

On one hand I understand this concept. But, I also feel so sluggish and unproductive. I didn‚Äôt have this feeling on my first antidepressant prescription, although I did have a clear lifting of my anxiety there, too. But my weight gain was unfortunately very rapid and not great. 

I am curious if others have any perspective on this situation. I‚Äôm lucky to be in a position where as a stay at home mom it‚Äôs not damaging my daily life (much) to always run to sleep, but it‚Äôs also holding me back from some goals and productivity. I also feel bad that I‚Äôm so lazy and not as engaging and energetic as I would like to be with my kids. But if it really is just part of a healing process, that‚Äôs worth waiting it out. If not, I need some perspective so I can better approach my situation with my dr.",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j43bt/is_it_normal_for_my_anxiety_meds_to_make_me_want/,rae--of--sunshine,

hi y‚Äôall, first-time poster (21F). i‚Äôve made a few posts in r/dpdr, but since mine is based in my anxiety i figured i‚Äôd come here for support.

had a massive panic attack on 12/6 that triggered the dp/dr. i‚Äôd had fleeting episodes of it a couple times before, but was always able to ignore them and move on with my life. now it‚Äôs pretty much been constant since the panic attack, and i am not having a good time. aside from feeling disconnected from my body and feeling like the world around me is a dream/hallucination, some existential ocd thoughts are also there and i feel like i‚Äôm going crazy. logically i know i‚Äôm real, however my nervous system is pretty much stuck in protection mode, so it won‚Äôt really listen to that logic. my brain‚Äôs greatest hits include:

‚Ä¢ ‚Äúwhat if all this is a dream? you‚Äôre gonna wake up soon.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúwhat if you have schizophrenia? you‚Äôve gotta be going crazy!‚Äù
‚Ä¢ *questioning the very fabric of reality*

i‚Äôve always been an anxious person. i‚Äôve had anxiety for as long as i can remember, but this is the first time in my life it‚Äôs gotten to this point. being chronically stressed, not sleeping properly, and ignoring my mental health last semester is essentially what did me in. i have one semester left and i want to enjoy it as much as possible. i‚Äôve also had existential thoughts before but they never bothered me like they do now.

i guess what i came here for is advice, support, etc. i recently started prozac 20 mg, and am starting therapy tomorrow. if you‚Äôd be willing to share your experiences with anxiety and dp/dr i‚Äôd really appreciate it. this week has just been a bad week for it and i‚Äôm very tired. thanks in advance ü´∂üèΩ",1,1.0,0,/r/Anxiety/comments/10j3yot/anxietyinduced_dpdr_help/,spacepharmacy,
