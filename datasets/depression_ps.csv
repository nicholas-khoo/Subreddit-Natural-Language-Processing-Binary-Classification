10moalc,1674835061,I think I finally broke completely,True,"The worst feeling in the world is hope, it makes you feel that things will be good for once in your life, so when, of course, things go to hell... you feel worse.

I have not been sleeping well at all during the last couple of days, crying, screaming, praying that for once things go well but today I got confirmation that they didn't. When I received the news I stopped crying, it is what it is and this is all my life is going to be it seems. While my friend is freaking out (the situation harms us both financially and academically speaking)  I'm just calm as a rock. She asked me very upset that if I just don't care about what is happening and I could not answer. 

But he thing is I don't, If I get sad about everything bad that happens to me then I'm going to be sad or upset pretty often so better be calm about it. 

I have this audio of my little niece saying: ""Hello uncle... I love you"". That used to remind me that there are great things to live for, but now I hear that and I feel nothing. 

At the end of the day I know that are good things out there but sometimes the bad comes around more often that the good.

10mmc1v,1674830162,"I can feel myself starting to descend irreversibly into depression, and I don't know how to stop it, or if I even want to stop it.",True,"I'm a 20M college student who's been struggling with depression on and off since the beginning of high school. My negative thoughts and total apathy during depressive episodes have robbed me of a lot of joy in life but I've always maintained moderate function-- I could keep up with schoolwork, keep up hygiene, and keep in contact with friends and family for the most part despite not feeling happy about life. However, recently I feel like I've slipped into a deeper depression, that not only makes me miserable but has taken my capability away as well. I've started missing work for classes, I struggle to even brush my teeth and much less shower, my room is a disgusting mess, I wear the same dirty clothes for days at a time, and I ignore messages from friends and family which is straining my relationships with them. In the last week I haven't been sleeping much at all and I've been eating less than 1000 calories a day, and I weirdly like the numb buzz it gives me as I can feel my body and brain in a dampened state because my mind has less energy to tear itself apart. The worst part is that my depressive symptoms feed off of each other and together they feel like a thousand pound weight on my chest. I feel as though in order to break out of this state I would need to upheave all of the things weighing down on me simultaneously and the thought of that energy expenditure makes me want to curl up and die rather than fight so hard. 

There is a small voice of reason in me that wants to put up a fight. It is the same voice that is compelling me to write this post to reach out and see if anyone with similar experience has any advice for snapping out of a strong depressive spell like mine. But what disturbs me the most is that the majority of my mind is content to let myself be washed away by this horrible disorder and let my life completely fall apart. My younger self used to have big dreams for my future; I look pack on that person and can't even recognize them anymore.

I mostly just wanted to get this off my chest. If anyone actually read through all of this and has any thoughts, though, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10mmc1v/i_can_feel_myself_starting_to_descend/,Small-Valuable2375,

10mkx9e,1674826429,There is no way out,True,"I am tired, I am very tired of this. Working is the most soul-destroying things ever where I have to wake up, depersonalize myself for 11 hours 5 days a week. It is not a matter of changing jobs or changing countries, I did it before and I know how it is. Its the same everywhere. Working means giving up on your personality, giving up your libery in order to just survive while missing what truly count in life, living. They want you to stop being yourself, they want you to destroy you otherwise and no matter what they will find a way to coerce you or force you to be what they want you to be.

I feel everyday like a bird that only wants to fly high, being trapped in a cage that become smaller and smaller. I am not depressed, my therapist told me that my eyes still shine for too many things in this life. Things that sadly I cannot do simply because of money, because yes, lets be grounded on this: money is freedom, the freedom to be yourself and live life by your own terms. I thought about suicide in the past but my rationality said that there is absolutely no point in dying. Death will only make me dead. I want relief, I want to live, I want to be free and I want to be authentic without being suppressed by people or circumstances. But there is no way out of this....its slavery, depersonalization for life or the coffin. Both options do not offer any kind of relief and I am tired, I am extremely tired. Whats even worse is that people do not understand this, people are ok with being a slave and the few people I know cannot do anything about it anyway. I feel defeated, oppressed, destroyed. I just would like to never been born. This life is nothing else than a prison.

At least, I am wise enough to never reproduce myself so I will not see my kids suffer and be enslaved like me and like all the others. Society is a bullshit, always been and always will be.

They'd look at the adult child, and think ""why did I waste my time and money raising that thing?""

Look at all the famous young people like Zendaya, Olivia Rodrigo, Timothee Chalamet, Tom Holland. Their parents would be proud to say ""my child is a millionaire movie star.""

10mjpb2,1674822776,I am desperately not ok,True,"This is my first post here and I’m not sure how many people are going to see it or how many people will relate but here goes.

TW* Contains talk of sexual trauma and suicide.

I’m a 39 year old male with no friends that spends all of my time alone in a room at home. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and have tried 4-5 different antidepressants none of which have had any effect on my condition.

The root cause of my depression is erectile dysfunction. From as far back as I can remember, from my first sexual experience with a female, I was 19 I think, I couldn’t maintain my erection. This led me to be wholly ashamed and embarrassed and led to me not wanting to have another sexual encounter again.

About a year later I met somebody new and we started to have sex, again my ED showed up and while I could sometimes maintain it long enough to climax I would also lose it often. I ended up getting her pregnant and having a son. We separated when he was about 6 months old and it led to 15 or so years of a very abusive relationship where she would psychologically abuse me through text messages and use my son against me as weapon.

My confidence was already rock bottom due to the ED, and in the years since I have had a few sexual experiences with other women but they have all ended the same way, with me not being able to get or maintain an erection.

The trauma of this has led me to become a shut in that never leaves my house, and turned to food for comfort, so I’m now massively overweight, almost 300lbs. 

It’s hard to have friends because they always ask me about girls and I obviously can’t disclose my ED to them because that would just be horrendous, I’ve already felt enough ridicule and embarrassment. So whatever friends I do make I just end up losing because I eventually push them away.

Living like this has caused me to become profoundly depressed, to the point where I can barely function, I never clean my house or myself  for that matter. It has also caused me to become extremely anxious, scared of everything. I just wish I could be normal and live a normal fulfilling life. 

I think about killing myself a lot, but the truth is I’m too much of a coward to do it even though I know it will end my suffering. I also don’t want to put that pain on my son and my sister/nephews/niece.

I’ve tried pills for my ED but they didn’t work, I feel like I’m not a real man and no woman wants a sexless relationship, unless they’re asexual, but the problem is my depression is so deep and severe that nobody would want to be with somebody who’s that down and apathetic.

Therapy is expensive and I lost my job last year, I’ve been surviving on my redundancy money, but that will soon run out, and I’m really struggling to pick myself up and get a job. I hated my last job so that no doubt played a part in my depression also.

I know it was a long piece, if you made it to the end thank you. I don’t have anyone to talk to, this is the only place I could post this with anonymity.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10mjpb2/i_am_desperately_not_ok/,CosmicPizza_,

But then I've adapted simple philosophy - you are either made into acceptable human being or despicable monster by the enviroment you live in, and you're not the one to decide which will it be. But with will strong enough you can decide what your actions will be despite your nature. I may have been ruined as a person but I'm not animal, I will not follow my instincts and emotions, that's what weak do, I am capable of being good person despite what my life has turned me into.

I think I had thought about it so much to a point where I lost sensitivity on the topic and death in general maybe because I joked about it too much and had been lucky enough that I had never lost a loved one before. My grandpa passed away a couple days ago. He had been sick for a while, but it hurt like nothing i could have ever imagined. I had never experienced a heartbreak this intense, but loosing him was not even the worst part of it. The worst part was my mom’s reaction. I had never seen my mother in such pain and know that there was nothing I could do about it. To see her scream, out of breath and close to having a panic attack made me realize that I would never want to put her through that. I love her way too much to ever cause an irreparable pain that would ultimately be MY decision. I think that many of us have been too deep into our depression that we have lost a sense of how unfixable death truly is and what that means for the people that get left behind. We have to take a moment to realize how short life actually is and how temporary our experience in this world is.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10mhf1x/after_loosing_my_grandpa_this_week_suicidal/,Sad_Perspective_2038,
10mhe7b,1674814053,Friends,True,"I’m a 33yr old male who used to have tons of friends and a very healthy social life. I’ve battled chronic illness along with depression since I was around 26-27 years old. I went through a very traumatic life changing benzodiazepine withdrawal at 28 and it altered everything for me. I “recovered” after a year and some change to the point that I could work again and wasn’t just laying in bed in agony 24/7 at my parents house, but I’ve slowly watched myself turn into a hermit over the last couple years. My best friend got married and I hardly ever see him or hear from him anymore. I live with my girlfriend in an apartment and all I do now is go to work and come home. I feel I’ve utterly lost my identity. I don’t know if I ever felt that strong in my identity in the first place but I’ve slowly lost connection with all things that I felt once made me “me”. I understand why the phone calls stopped. I understand people have to live their own lives and when you are consistently down in the dumps I can understand why you wouldn’t want to be around that. I feel like I never have the energy to make connection anymore, even connections that used to be so strong. One missed call turns into twenty and then my shame and guilt kicks in and I feel like I can’t even reach back out, and I often don’t for weeks or months at a time. I don’t even feel worthy of friendships. Most of my buddies make well over a 100k a year and have their lives together. Meanwhile I never kicked off a career because I was always recording and singing and focused on music in my 20s. I know they don’t exactly judge my lack  of money but I can’t help but feel very insecure about it. I didn’t realize how many connections can be lost in growing older. I feel so changed by all this trauma that I often feel like old friends can’t even fathom what exactly I went through and they just expect me to shake it off and to just “get better”. I lost all my creativity during this and it feels like I don’t even have a soul at this point. I think there are some friendships I should try and salvage but I’ve realized that some may not worth be rebuilding. I feel I’ve grown emotionally and spirtually during this process and I feel certain friends just won’t ever accept that or respect me the way I want them to. I just want to learn to love and respect myself and have people in my life that genuinely care for me. I pray I can find a way to re connect and to forge new and healthy male friendships.

This is how I take my bath.

You need: a bath, a bath oil (I use QV) a sponge, wash cloth (whatever you can rub yourself with) and your soap/ shower gel.


1. Fill the bath with water that is hot but not unbearable. This is the key to getting clean.


2. Squirt a generous amount of bath oil into the water. You should see it on the surface. 


3. Get in the bath and soak for 10 minutes while the water is nice and hot. Wash your face. Soak a little longer. Quickly wash your pits and bits and then discard the wash cloth out of the bath. 


4. Drain the bath but DONT GET OUT. Let the water drain away and turn a couple of times. This will allow the bath oil to coat your body.


5. This is key- STAY in the empty tub. Get comfortable and let yourself dry as much as possible. Turn over and allow as much as possible to airdry. I usually take 20 minutes or so. The bath oil is absorbing and moisturising your skin. No need to add a cream to your body. This works like a charm for me.


6. When you are basically dry, get out (don't slip!) And pat dry any wet areas. Get dressed in a comfy top and undies and get back into bed. 


7. Do this twice a week to keep your skin moisturised and supple. If you enjoy a face care routine, keep doing this. Some people have oily faces and do not need the extra bath oil on their face (including me). 


8. When/if you can be bothered, wipe out the bath with a dry cloth so it is ready for next time.

All this is in regards to how, I can't find the right words for this so I'm going to try to put it in the best possible way I can, and I have been brief moments of kindness but for the most part anything that I have been through or anything that has troubled me, to quote her ""what concern is it of mine"" .

10mdxqj,1674800023,I miss my dad (please someone who relates talk to me),True,"
My dad was the best growing up. We would go fishing all the time, he’d take me to all my hockey games and hockey tournaments and we’d j have a great time together doing everything together. I was close with my mom too and all my siblings. My family’s was perfect. Everyone got along and I thought that my parents had the best relationship ever. Right before I turned 17, my mom tells me that my dad has been cheating on her for the last two years. This absolutely killed me. My dad my hero my mentor who I never would have guessed in a million years to do something like this did it.  He was then talking to the other girl about how he was going to leave our family and get a deep sea boat for the 2 of them (me and his dream). I kept trying to think of ways that maybe this wasn’t as bad as it actually was.
My mom got into an argument with him that night and it was the first time I ever heard them yell at each other. My mom storms out of my house and later they both come into my room and my dad says that he will stop seeing the girl and that he was so sorry for his actions.
We take a trip onto our granparents boat, me my mom and my dad, and we have such a great time and I hope that maybe he actually did change.
When we get back however I find out it isn’t the case. My mom packs her things and goes to our other house, taking me and both my brothers but my sister wanted to start with my dad. 
My dad then started filing lawsuits and suing my mom for every possible thing to try to get her to lose as much money as possible and him to take as much as he can. 
Every week my dad texts me saying about how he misses me and how he wants to have food with me or take me to my hockey games or go fishing and it’s j part of his manipulative ideals. 
Even if this was actually a way to make it up with me because he still loves me I don’t understand how he would choose this girl over his 3 sons. If I ever did something like this I would instantly realize the effect on my poor kids and stop it, and I would also try every possible thing to make it up to my kids. My dad has done neither.
I’ve been really depressed lately. Missing my dad and school work is killing me. I try to act like nothing is different at school but I think about him every day. I took all the fun times with him for granted and I haven’t talked to him in months. I really pray that he has a change of heart so maybe we can save any part of our relationship. I don’t really eat anymore or sleep or leave my room. I have nobody to really look out for me besides my mom and brothers but I don’t want them to know I feel this way.

As the title says, I am pathetic. I've never been formally diagnosed with depression, given that my parents don't believe in mental health. Well, at least not enough to do anything about it. It wasn't until the last couple of years that I really felt depressed, and it really hit hard in 2022. It started when I was dumped as most stories go. It was the classic, I liked her, and she wasn't ready for a comment, same old story. After that, I just felt bad in general during the next semester of school. Then something positive happened, I got an internship and made some friends during it. It was honestly the best summer I'd had in a very long time. They cared, and for once, I didn't have to initiate every interaction. 

But as always, the fun comes to an end, and I came back home, no support network, no friends, nothing. At the same time my parents and brother started their own buisness and they're doing very well for themselves now and I'm honestly proud of them. However, here I am, 24 years old, to anxious to get my driver's license, no job because of school (and possibly ADHD), and no social life, like I said, pathetic. I'm in college, tho, so maybe that's something.

I don't honestly know where I'm going with this or why I'm posting. Maybe I just needed to vent or tell someone who might care, who knows. Here's hoping things start looking up.

10mcx72,1674796500,"Damn I'm starting to wonder if people actually aren't superficial, irritating assholes, and it's just me that's depressed",True,"People only talk about things that feel so shallow to me that I assume they must just be being superficial. like I feel like everything has to be so G rated but I have a very cynical and dry sense of humor and it seems like most people think I'm a real asshole. It's something that makes me feel quite guilty. It's the absolute worst when someone you thought you were becoming friends with becomes more careful and distant with you compared to other people. I love making people laugh, and when I was a kid I would until they cried, and I miss that. I never laugh with people anymore and when I try it gets awkward. I never poke fun at \*people\* though, or if I do I'm very careful to make it about a behavior or position of authority they're in, but I'm not sure if it comes off that way. It's like, my communication style though, like I can't just be a straight shooter for the life of me so I'm left to fake being the type of person that won't piss people off and it leaves me an anxious wreck. I just feel very misunderstood in general but theres this voice in my head that tells me ""If it smells like shit everywhere you go check the bottom of your shoe"" and that I might just be stubbornly refusing to listen to what anyone else is telling me without realizing it. 

I really like death metal, which is something I've never discovered before, but I love its depravity. The vile, disgusting rottenness of it feels like it's there to convey an underlying truth, but my mom keeps lightly poking fun at my interest in it, which I laugh along with, but subtly seeming like she's actually put off by it. For example, I turned 19 a few days ago and decided I wanted to do something for myself, so I made myself a cake full of fake cherry juice and a banana cut to look like maggots and a gravestone on top that said ""18"" on it. Disgusting, I know, and it was a little hard to eat, but that's what was fun about it. I mean it's okay on halloween and this FELT the same, but maybe it wasn't. I was actually proud of how good it came out but she was very hesitant and trying not to act disgusted by it, even though I warned her and told her it was totally fine to be. Idk, maybe I'm just so out of touch that I'm not even aware that I'm being problematic. 

I'm scared to say anything for fear of making people angry at this point. Maybe it's less the things I say and more me? Maybe something about me makes people feel nervous around me. Idk. I also recenly transitioned from female to male so some of my behaviors might have been fine from a girl but socially unacceptable from a man. Men are shallow af though, I feel like a lot of their jokes amount to ""your penis small, women are dumb/bad/mean, you're gay, racism"", but women feel like they have their guard up around me, and maybe that's true for all men, but it makes me feel really shitty. Women I thought liked me and would say hi to/joke with a lot I've seen act like a completely different person around their actual friends and have realized that they were actually just being nice. I don't blame them at all obviously but i am horrified at the realization that I've been making them feel uncomfortable. It's honestly incredibly frustrating that people aren't being authentic about how they feel about me, and it's a frustration towards myself, not them, because I realize that if that's the case it's because they don't feel safe to be, or that I wouldn't be able to handle it, which is very understandable. It would honestly be less hurtful if they would be brutally honest with me though.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10mcx72/damn_im_starting_to_wonder_if_people_actually/,Afraid_Diet_6120,

10mcnzd,1674795655,im done,True,"Honestly I don’t even think I’m depressed, I just think my life is kinda rough right now and I just keep getting hit with something horrible every day like the world is against me. I go to a small private school and maybe it’s different at a public school but everywhere I look, almost everyone is happy and has everything. Nearly everyone is rich and has a whole lot of friends and always hang out. I have friends but not a friend group, just a few of different “best friends” that have no affiliation with each other. Im not trying to pull some edgy shit by saying “im shy and awkward” but I genuinely am and it sucks. I don’t even do anything that would normally get someone bullied like I play sports and dress like a normal teenager but I just can’t talk. I think people think I’m weird because I can’t really talk with about being super awkward and I don’t necessarily get bullied (except today but that was just weird) but no one really comes up and talks to me. And then Im scared to come home everyday because there’s a 75% chance that my mom will be angry or drunk (or both) and I’ll spend my afternoon being told I’m stupid and not like my brothers and yelled at for whatever I do. My soccer coach almost called CPS on my parents after I burst into tears during a game because I was so scared of going home that night, I told him I was just scared about her getting angry that I did bad on my chem test when in reality I was scared she had a bad day at work and would yell at me all night and make me eat outside again. She takes her anger at anything out on me, if she’s not yelling she doesn’t really care about me. It just makes me angry because sometimes I think I’m socially awkward because of the way I was and continue to be treated at home and I just have a fear of people being like her. I don’t want to feel so sad to go to school, and so scared to go home. I’m already anxious about senior night for soccer and tennis because I know I won’t have anyone to walk me up, because they don’t care, no one cares, it’s no one’s job to care so I guess I can’t complain. The world just doesn’t seem fair. I don’t want things. I didn’t have a birthday or get a present. All I wanted on my past birthday, my “sweet 16” was a stouffers lasagna. I didn’t get it. I didn’t get a present. But I wasn’t disappointed. My birthday was never really special. I just want what everyone else around me seems to have. These people have seemingly perfect lives, and I don’t even have my lasagna. I feel really alone in the world (once again not trying to pull edgy shit) I want to talk to my bio teacher about it but I’m scared to talk about the abuse and how legitimately sad I am, because why should any other human being have to care about what’s wrong in my life. There’s so many other people going through so much worse. I ended up writing today because I sat in the bio teachers room during lunch and we have these kids that come in to take a bio test 3 days a week so I genuinely haven’t seen them before ever and they were throwing stuff at me when the bio teacher wasn’t in the room and normally I wouldn’t care but I was upset when I came in to begin with and I felt like ending everything when I came in this morning. And then as I was waking out to my car I slipped on the insanely slick parking lot and the lower half of my body went up and it was such a big backwards fall and everyone started laughing at me and it was honestly kinda funny but now I have rocks in my legs still like under my skin and I need to figure out how to get them out. 100 percent no one read all of this but it’s alright because I just need to vent for a bit.

10mcfla,1674794906,Death is better than life (non negative post),True,"I am not saying I am better off dead because ""I'm useless"" or anything like that. Nothing negative but here's why...

Suicidal thoughts have ate at me since I was 10 but I wasn't truly depressed YET. I actually started feeling severely depressed around 2 years ago. 

Depression is WAY too complicated to deal with, especially if your life is shit and stress/loneliness is contributing to 90% of it. 

It also sucks when you're only 17 battling severe depression since 15 and no one will take you seriously and your family refused to get you a doctor until just recently, and now it feels way too late. I was even sent to talk therapy in the past and it didn't help me whatsoever, only made me feel like a complete loser. 

I also suffer from chronic migraines (extreme daily pain)

So logically, I'd be WAY better off dead. This is WAY too much to deal with, and I doubt I'll ever truly find a solution. I can literally feel myself developing dementia already.

I’ve been on SSRIs (that didn’t play well with me), HRT (long story), and most recently an NDRI. This latest med has been working really well for the last 3 years, managing to keep me riding the happy edge of neutral. This past year, though, life and my stress levels decided to take a nose-dive.

My therapist suggested that I increase my dose, which I did, and it worked really well for about 6 months. And now I’m numb… the stress balls keep coming, and I’m handling them as well as I suppose could be expected, but now I’m laying awake night after night desperately wishing for some cathartic release in the form of a good solid cry and wishing for a brain aneurism to take me away.

I'm gonna list off reasons why I think I may have depression and reasons why I doubt i have it

Reasons why I think I have it:

.no motivation for anything
.think I'm a nuisance to everyone I meet
.always thinking people hate me
.overeating (I've gained a ton of weight since 2022)
.not wanting to do anything with myself
.thinking about ways I could die 
.I hate myself
.have become distant to close friends including family members
.questioning if have a future as a regular citizen 
.generally just feeling sadder then I used to be

Reasons why I doubt i have it:

.I don't actually want to die

She smokes and spends $700 a month on cigarettes. I tell her constantly to stop, she refuses to listen. She dumps money into those Facebook casino games. I tell her to stop, she refuses to listen. I'm trying to keep her afloat, but she somehow finds ways to spend more money and take more from me. Now that she knows I'm helping out financially, she feels like she has the right to spend more and more. I keep telling her to stop, I have my own bills to pay, she wont listen. I told her to just sell the house and live on that, but she refuses to sell unless she fixes it up, but she wont fix it up because she doesn't have the money to.

Everyone just tells me to cut her off and leave her, but she has no one else. She's useless at life, she can't even remember a password for websites, and everything is done online. I give her numbers to call for social workers, she never calls, or takes months to eventually make the call.

Most of the things in your life, don’t happen according to your plan. I have been through hell. I have been through depression and its most advance forms. Imagine, when you don’t have the depression. You are on the surface of the water where you can breathe. Once you drown that is called depression. And it, totally depend on the depth of the water. The more deep the water or hell is, the more you gonna suffer. When you are suffering, always think how to reach the surface. Some tools to help you are: Omega 3, fatty acids, vitamin D etc. There are many supplements to make you feel better, the mood boosters. The only cure for depression is to have good feelings. So do your best to boost your mood. Another helpful tool is to eradicate or eliminate the root cause of depression, anyway possible.

Convex and concave:

	Please go search for the meaning of convex and concave. Those are actually the lenses used for the glasses to see near and far. Concave is more like hyperbolas and convex is more like eclipse. What I am trying to say is be more convex than concave. That me be more positive towards the world possibly than to be more negative towards the world possibly. The more convex, the more you get hope towards the world and positivity.

Hate:

	Depression brings hate towards the world. As long as, you can handle the hate, you are good but, when you can’t handle the hate, the negativity towards the world will eat you alive. So be careful with the hate.

Hey, so a little background, 18yr girl.

I have this issue where when I find a person or a friend I try to do everything in my capacity to make sure they stay. Which sounds psychotic but hear me out. I mostly do this by acts of service, spending quality time, giving gifts, and just talking whenever I can, but it gets to a point where when they don't talk as much or change their normal way of talking to me it's like all the alarms go off in my head and I try even harder, this is the part where friendships just end. I say stuff like being around you makes me feel happy and safe and I start to open up about why I act the way I do from past trauma which is essentially trauma dumping. The friends I make then feel like they owe me their company or worry I'm going to go off the deep end. I don't want to be that kind of burden to anyone, I want to be a good person but I'm also so scared of people leaving that it gives me anxiety attacks. I get scared when people left me on read, and it just feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy when eventually they leave. It just feels like I'm trying to hold onto the people that come into my life with every ounce of my power and it gets released all at once when they go, like holding onto some metaphorical rope I feel like I'm just landing on my face every time somebody gets out of that grasp. I just feel really alone, unlovable, and nobody I care about will ever stay. I know it's my fault and I'm trying to work on it but how do I even start? Enjoying being alone just turns into isolation, and when I focus on my study instead I'm still feeling alone. I don't have any friends that accept the issues I come with. Do the issues that I have make me psychotic and draining to be around? Is there any chance somebody might be okay with my clinginess and fear of abandonment?",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10m9f9b/my_abandonment_issues_are_destroying_all_of_the/,Curious-Bag-8993,

Hello I am 15 and a sophomore in high school. I have maybe 1 real friend the rest are either mean to me most of the time or only school friends.

So on top of dealing with problems from my ""friends"", swim team and the school i have to deal with it at home. And on the comment of me being black earlier im not even really black im mixed race and dont live with any black people or people like me. Im not obese but overweight and that causes me alot of mental strain, im into supposed ""nerdy"" things yet i dont even have a real hobby.

10m8ix5,1674783039,i just don’t know what to do (15f),True,"no one’s gonna read this but here i go :)

everyone at school hates me, every day i get weird/dirty looks in the hallways from people i don’t even know and i have no idea why. whenever i tell people they think it’s because i’m new to the district and they’re shocked and think it’s weird when i tell them that i’ve lived there my entire life (which means I’ve basically grown up with the people in my grade). 

i have only one friend, and even though we’ve been friends since sixth grade we just don’t have that sorta, bond, persay, where we could tell each other our biggest secrets and vent to each other. sometimes she’ll make these “jokes” about stuff that i do, whether it’s something small like me taking long to finish my algebra final last year or the way i stutter when talking to someone else. i know it’s just a lighthearted joke, and she’s not trying to make fun of me, but it just hurts.

other than that, we’re still very close and genuinely a good person, and i think i’m being too sensitive when it comes to these things.

i also have social anxiety, which causes me to believe that the reason why everyone at school thinks i’m weird is because i keep to myself and don’t talk to anyone. 

i have no hobbies, no interests, and all i do is sit around on my phone all day because im not good at ANYTHING.

my parents are never really there for me emotionally. every time i go to one of them for help (mainly my mom) she usually either just gives me this uncomfortable blank stare as if waiting for me to say something or straight up tells me “I don’t know what to tell you” or changes the subject to completely random. other than that I’m really close to my parents and i love them so much but it just sucks that they’re not emotionally there for me you know? but i also think it’s because i have two older sisters and neither of them have gone through anything remotely similar to this so they’re just not mentally prepared for anything like this and i cant blame them.

back to the school thing, i want to switch schools SO FUCKING BADLY for a fresh start. but the school i go to is the only high school in the district and theres no online option available so unless my parents decide to move in the future i’m basically fucked until i graduate :)

on top of this i’ve been diagnosed with depression since fifth grade (10-11 year olds) and ive been seriously contemplating suicide for a while now. whenever ive told my mom about these thoughts she gets REALLY mad (not physical or anything but still) so me going here is basically my last resort.

ive been going to therapy for this since may of last year and its honestly not helping at all, every session i find myself repeating the same things over and over again. i havent told her about these thoughts yet, and if i do shell end up talking to my mom about it which will make her really mad.

tl;dr: everyone at school hates me, no one wants to speak up and tell me why and im wasting my high school years because of it, i have depression and social anxiety, i have no hobbies interests or talents, i have absolutely no one to talk to and i just dont know what to do and ive been having suicidal thoughts again",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10m8ix5/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_15f/,weird-outcast,
10m8hiv,1674782928,School is destroying me and pushing me into a void of depression.,True,"[Vent] Not going to get too much into detail so I will just only talk about the main point, I'm 15 and I've been struggling with depression for 3-2 years now and I'm going to therapy to try and get rid of it.
My attendace has been going back and forth between 60 and 80% since all this shit started but this year the depression has gotten so paralysing that I have reached 30% attendace and my parents might get sued because of it. I am terrified because of this and its causing more stress, more anxiety, and overall makes me worse.
I don't even want to think about the consequences that might appear soon but it's not like I can pull a switch and change this illness.
I am drowning in a abyss, have no strength to get out of bed and every single person around me is mad at me. Mad at me that I am depressed, sad, anxious and just an overall mess. I honestly understand it because I would react the same way to myself. I keep self sabotaging by not eating or sleeping and at this point I feel like I deserve it. I just feel horrible that people I care about are being punished for something that I am casuing in which I have no control over.

My 2023 resolution was fixing all of this, but on new year's eve I got sick and had to stay at home for a total of 21 days which DESTROYED my motivation of anything this year or any hope I had of fixing this stupid problem.
Right now I am going to school but I feel like every day that I fail to do so is another step towards a void in which I cant come back from.
Every time I cant succeed to go a full 5 days of school in a week my parents threat me like shit reminding me of what a mess I've become. No one cares that I went from not getting out of bed for 5 motnths, barely eating, not sleeping to going almost every day to school, or at least trying to... .
 I fail once to do ANYTHING and I am a failure in everyone's eyes. 

There is too much noise in my head from all of this. I'm writing this at 1 am knowing I have school today but cant sleep because of it.

I have tried two differents medications and I'm still depressed to this day. I'm currently seeing a therapist, it has been almost 3 months and I do not really feel better. I have such a low self esteem and such a poor confidence in my abilities. I always hated the way I looked, I have always hated seeing/taking pictures of me. I constantly kept looking at myself in the mirror when I was a teenager, I was obsessed, I was trying to ""fix"" my face and my body, that is why I had an ED. However I stopped doing this, but I just don't look at myself in the mirror anymore. It sometimes makes me feel distressed, other times I will just feel disgust toward myself. But that's not everything. I have always felt different, I always had few friends, I never really connected with anyone in my life. I always felt more mature and ""intelligent"" than other people of my age, I always felt alone, even when in groups and in social settings. I tried so hard to fit in when I was a teenager, but it never worked. I just can't.

I consider myself to be a very existential being. I have such a hard time doing things... because I can't see the point of life. I just can't, there is no point to life. Everything that we are doing is not going to be remembered, it does not matter. I often think about existential questions, as why life exist, what happens after death, questions about the universe. I don't understand how the majority of people can work for example, such a pointless and time consuming thing in our limited tiny life in the span of the universe. People get anxious, are passionated about their jobs. I just can't understand when nothing matters in life, there is no meaning to life. I have always been atheist because I can't lie to myself that religion is real and spirituality is the answer when it's just logically not and it makes me super depressed because fuck I would love to think otherwise and not struggle with just seeing a point of living. I just want to say that I do not have active sucidal ideation... do not worry. But if I had been asked before being born if I wanted to live, I would have said NO. But now I am here.

I don't know how to deal with all of this. I keep myself occupied with video games because this is the only escape from the meaningless pointless life. It is also an escape from me. From dealing with all of this. At least my parents understand my situation and I do not have to worry about working and having to pay rent... I am grateful for that, because honestly I would die.

10m831l,1674781731,I hope there’s more to it than this,True,"Today a memory came back to me that I’d forgotten for a while. Back in school, I used to sneak out of bed late at night to check out all the stuff a 10-year-old boy doesn’t want his parents knowing about on the family computer. ""Boob,"" ""Butt,"" ""Girl taking off clothing""... the stuff of intellectuals. A handful of my friends at the time were hackers and coders in the making so I knew all I needed to be sure my family wouldn’t know. Never got caught. It became a habit.
 
Believe it or not, it wasn’t all just that. Curiosity has always been my kryptonite. That’s what I was indulging in most of the time, really. Morbid curiosities, taboo curiosities, workplace machinery accident videos, chatrooms packed with pedophiles… I had a phase where I’d join chatrooms intended for suicidal people to discuss their feelings. What they usually turned out to be was 4 or 5 people individually ranting at the rest with no concern for what the others were saying, at least 1 just repeating some form of ""goodbye"" or suicide threat, and the odd one out every few groups who’d try to help but be drowned in so much pain from the others that they’d just end up doing more harm in the process. It was so fascinating in a real way. Before then, my only experience with suicidal behavior was going to the funerals of suicide victims I knew. No one was close enough to me that I would’ve witnessed those dark, most genuine moments before their deaths.
 
I learned a lot from the corners of the internet. A lot of us did, I’m sure. I learned more about what extreme pain could do to a person’s mentality. I learned more about how cruel people are capable of being, why we are capable of that, who and what we subject to that cruelty. That computer filled the gaps of my very limited lived experience at the time. That lived experience came along, though. I got older. Saw more, knew more, matured more. I became more depressed throughout middle school, more so in high school, buried a friend, dropped out of a free ride at a good university, continued to put in a shitty excuse for work at a job I should’ve been fired from a long time ago, slutted around because I was bored, was still bored, tried to force myself to love someone who genuinely loved me because I realized I’d never come close to loving or having a significant connection with anyone, broke their heart, broke another the same way, stopped talking to everyone, and you’re pretty much caught up.
 
I’m 21 years old now. That’s probably young for a lot of you. I’m physically healthy, not ugly enough to be all that upset about, intelligent enough to stumble through most of life on my feet, and I have a pretty privileged set of life opportunities easily within my grasp... I don’t want anything from all of that. I don’t want to be the best at anything; I don’t want a girl to settle down with, not even sex really anymore; I don’t want a lot of money; I don’t desire any object all that much; I don’t want new friends; I don’t want to talk to the friends I have; I don’t want to write screenplays like I used to, at least not for anyone but myself; I don’t want much at all. I don’t enjoy much of anything. I’ve tried therapy. I usually end up hyper-focusing on whether they’re actually capable of challenging me in a productive way or not, being a manipulative little shit in the process, or putting the therapist in a position where we can’t get anything done. The few times I’ve felt like opening up was a decent idea, it wasn’t. I’ve tried drugs—most of the ones that don’t kill you at least. Prescription, not prescription. I don’t get much out of them anymore.

I feel like a child complaining about all this. There’s so much worse out there. I guess that’s part of why I’m posting on the internet instead of having a real conversation. Definitely not above pride. I’m mostly an asshole now. I still have some abstractish level of empathy but it comes close to killing me every time I let it in. It feels like I can’t bear the grief of a single living thing without being crushed by the weight of all of them. Morality isn’t much of a concern to me anymore; at least not in a way that matters. The way I see it, morality makes monsters out of us. It’s a tool to slowly shove every living thing besides you into the dirt with a quietness that’s so fucking eerie it keeps me up at night. It’s the art of hypocrisy. It’s what puts us at the top of the food chain. What we call morality makes sure the ones we decide are undesirable are shunned, demonized, or forgotten if it can be managed. sentenced to aching alone in themselves while the blame is shoved back into their hands through half-baked rationalizations of people too full of themselves to hold their piece. Over decades, the desirable ones are clawed at and eaten away in small slices by smiling faces. They’re liquidated and distributed until they're reduced to the undesirables they used to beat away. Where they thought they saw friends, fucking hyenas. That’s just in ""civilized"" society. We have our products manufactured in countries with concentration camps; we eat the corpses of enslaved animals; we stomp bugs for existing; and we kill plants by the billions on the convenient assumption they don’t ""feel,"" which is something we’ve barely begun to understand…
 
I’m tired of pretending we are capable of actual goodness and fairness. I’m tired of listening to people pretend to know wtf they’re talking about. Myself included. Each and every one of us stands on a mountain of corpses, most of which we never gave a moment’s consideration. There are no virtues. They’re all born of uncaring utility. There’s no good, no evil. Only good to what end and what bears the cost. There’s no heroes, only hypocrites and their beneficiaries. The mountain of corpses you stand on isn’t enough for you and never will be. We’re driven by appetites, not integrity. We’re just dying of thirst.
 
I thought there was so much more to this growing up. Maybe there is. Maybe I just can’t see it. Maybe I’ve let my bitterness turn my world upside-down. Maybe this obsessive, constant fucking need I have to stay up for days at a time and deconstruct every human behavior into its simplest parts is wildly unnatural and killing me slowly. Nobody can convince me life doesn’t feel like some worthless, depressing loop. I’m practically a crazy person these days. I don’t think you’d find me typing a 7-paragraph Reddit post if I weren’t.

Of course with the shift to remote work it became harder to change jobs/ careers. I was finishing my undergrad during this time as well and that broke me mentally. But I finally graduated this past December and just sent off my applications for grad school🤞🏽 

I informed my boss of my final day at work and it feels like I’m crawling on my hands and knees to that end date. My job has been a toxic mess and sucked the absolute life out of me. I disassociate just to even function at work. So knowing that it’s clear to my colleagues that I’m really leaving has given me a beacon of hope to cling to.

I hope I can live again. I hope I get accepted to grad school and can finally study what I’m really passionate about (Archives 🤘🏽). I hope I can be a better wife and friend.

10m6yjy,1674778543,Traumatizing them back,True,"I (22f) cut contact with the person who gave birth to me a year ago. That person sexually and physically abused me as a child and I only recently have been able to begin processing the reality of it all since I've finally had distance from her. I have never had so much anger inside of me before.


Well, I started texting her graphic details of the times she sexually abused me. 


These times she has always remembered, but always tried to convince me never happened. I always knew they happened, but pressing the subject in the face of her denial, I never dared to do. because 1) there were huge consequences to upsetting her and 2) these memories caused me enormous distress. they affected me sexually and psychologically. supressing this trauma was my brains way of surviving around her, and children are capable of incredible things for survival. Because of my compliance built apon my own survival and unconditional love, the one who violated me has been able to live comfortably in her own illusion. I've never had more anger and resentment in my life as i do now that I've finally begun to process everything.


I started texting her things I would have never dared to ever speak to her. The amount of denial on her part has frustrated me to this point of just wanting her to feel what she made me feel. wanting her to fucking look at her god damned self, and realize that the small girl she so happily took advantage of, is not an open source to milk love from anymore. not an open source to milk for comfort from her own reflection anymore. want her to fucking look at herself. The texts ive sent her are me telling her she deserves **graphic detail of what she did to me**, while telling her i know how much she has masturbated to the memories. i have never spoken to her in this vulgar cruel way. it hurts me to carry this anger. but im already here. She traumatized me, and I wish it apon her 10x. the most these texts will do is disturb and surprise her, for about .05 of a second before she somehow rationalizes it in her own favor and adds it to her self-given credits of how Christian and good she is.


I know this retaliation technically makes me ""look bad"" but for the past 22 years she's been happy to do that to me, no matter how much service I was to her. I have nothing to lose. i can only try not to commit suicide. invisioning her in the most violent violations (the ones she sexually gratified herself by doing to me) is something that just started happening in my mind. its awful and horrible to experience these feelings but I just wish them all apon that person 10x more.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10m6yjy/traumatizing_them_back/,traumamauart,

Please keep in mind that I'm below the age of 16 and this is my first time actually feeling these feelings and this is how I felt would work! This is the first 3-4 paragraphs I have written.

Chapter 1: Why.

I wonder, why don't people seem to like me? I didn't do anything. And I know people say this all the time and they end up being horrible people, but really, I didn't do anything. I have some friends, but not friends in my grade. Emily and Amber are the true friends I have, that's it. I don't get what I have done and why some people think im stupid.

I seem to only have a few friends but once again, why? I don’t pick on anyone, gossip, or even talk about anyone really. I just chat with Emily and Amber as much as I can. Drake I can talk to whenever but we are completely opposite people. He’s crazy and fun, and I'm a calmer person compared to him. Think Yin and Yang, Soldier and King. I'm the ying, he's the yang. I'm the king, he's the soldier. I don’t quite remember how we met. It seems like a century ago when we did. We have a few classes together, and they're nice. I wish I could have friends like Drake. Be out there in the world. Known to people. Not just known as “the random tall girl in my class who sometimes makes me laugh.”

Sometimes I feel like the song “Heat Lightning” by Mitski is sometimes too literal when in the context of myself. “Heat Lightning, watching from the doorstep.” I could never be out there. I'm too scared of what I would do to myself. I can’t even talk to my own mother without arguing. I never start the arguments but it just seems to happen. I hate it, with a burning passion.

Chapter 2: M is for Music

10m5wlk,1674775683,"If you read me, I appreciate it, I really do.",True,"I don't know how to start this right but I'll give it a try (I translated all this, since I speak Spanish).
I don't feel like doing anything, I have to look for a summer job and then one for the weekends when I start studying my third year of my career.
Everything stopped seeming important to me because I don't feel the strength to continue, a slight encouragement but no power of execution.
I have a partner for about 4 years, a few months ago I got pregnant (my gynecologist told me I was infertile) we did not even have enough to eat, and with the pain of my soul I had an abortion.
The simple fact of having an abortion is a secret and something that has weighed on me, especially because I almost lost my life in that, my boyfriend has tried to give me his support but I feel that no matter how hard he tries he will not be able to encourage me.
Moreover, at this point I feel a great pressure from him for me to fulfill what I promised to do, which is to work, however I do not feel the strength to be able to, or that anxiety about interacting with so many people stop me from creating false scenarios.
The encouragement from society, influercers ,etc is always : ""go to therapy , it's wonderful"".
Here's the thing: all the money that comes in, which is very little, is for survival, because I don't even feel like it's good for living anymore.
My friends stopped inviting me out, because they know that I will say that I can't go out, it's always because I can't even buy a bottle of water, I'm ashamed that I can't socialize anymore.
We live with my parents, after not being able to cope with the life of renting a house, it is more to say that my parents since I can remember until I was 21 years old were so overprotective and psychologically abusive, going back to their house generated me remember all this.
(They went to the level of humiliating me for starting a sex life, kicking the doors if I went in to urinate or insulting me if I went in to do something else, cutting off my hot water, unplugging the electricity, hitting me twice, hiding my food in closets, not providing me with good education, health, forcing me to help raise my younger brother, and the obligation to always be silent, They didn't let me play guitar, they didn't let me read because they thought I should be cleaning their things, they didn't let me go out with friends), they gave me the illusion that I could enter the university, I entered and when I paid my tuition, they told me I couldn't, I entered nursing so I could feel their pride, it wasn't like that, I had to quit before I started because there wasn't the money they told me there would be. Years later, falsifying papers to obtain economic benefits, they gave me free tuition to study, I got into any career in order to enter, because they were asking for very little score, this in order to get me into a career of my liking after passing some courses, to do this I entered art with which I stayed, a dream career for me, they yelled at me for this (I did it on the sly). Entering I ran into people who did not have all these difficulties , they were people with a lot of money , many of these very classist , they have discriminated against me for coming from where I come from , it feels horrible , it is terrible for me to see that I have envy and jealousy since in this line of work you have to have contacts , and I am no one .
The psychological abuse of my parents decreased considerably when I went to another country with the partner with whom I am still with, when I arrived again they began to ""support"" me, they began to give me some money to be able to pay for my career, rent, among other things. After so many years of abuse it was strange , however I do not trust them , they are still manipulative , narcissistic and stupid , psychologically they know how to hurt me , tell me something about my weight even in my adolescence when I was at the limit of my weight , Bursts of memories of the things told before come to me , I do not feel self esteem . 
Self , and all the strength I have put into pushing myself all alone is gone .

I filled out the paperwork and answered the questionnaire they sent me as honest as possible... Albiet I tiptoed a little bc I'm so afraid of being admitted to a hospital against my will.

Now I'm feeling kinda apprehensive? I think thats the right word.

Like, idk how I'm going to act when I get there. Can I actually bring myself to speak properly when I've been struggling to talk all this week? I'm hoping they'll ask questions that won't be too hard to answer, that can guide me along to really pinpoint what's wrong with my head. They're a trained professional so I'm sure they know what to do.

I'll try my hardest to help them help me I guess.

And if all goes well my dad and I might go to the Cheesecake Factory afterwards. He has a gift card 🤣 but it really depends on how I feel after the appointment. Right now the thought of eating out and pretending to be happy again is still exhausting...

...Moving on to a totally different topic - my mom is finally taking real steps to getting my grandma admitted into a nursing home. She's getting all sorts of documents prepared and is hand-delivering everything to the physical location rather than email because she's old school LOL. Says she wants to make sure they get the stuff and nothing gets lost, and she wants to avoid any mail fees. When she told me she'll actually get my grandma admitted I didn't believe her. I... Still don't. To be completely honest. I'll never be convinced until I physically see my grandma leave the house and move into the nursing home.

The whole thing just leaves a super bitter taste in my mouth.

It takes me, wishing to die, writing a will, and feeling like absolute shit, for you to get off your ass and do something that should have been done ages ago? You turn away all of my offers of help, wait until I'm incapable of helping, and then finally take action when it's a million times harder to do?

She's always been stubborn but damn let other people help you sometimes.

10m48i3,1674771423,I don’t know what to do,True,"So I’m a 21 year old Male. I still live with my parents. I currently work in retail at a supermarket 3 days a week. I passed college 3 years ago, I did an Animation for Games and Media course. When I finished my GCSEs in school I had no idea what my career was going to be. All I knew is that from a very young age I loved playing video games and was always interested in how they were designed and created. That’s why I chose to study Animation for Games and Media at College.

I have a place to study Games Design at University this September. I was going to go 3 years ago back in 2020 but due to the COVID lockdowns and depression I chose not to go. I basically did nothing throughout 2020 and 2021, I didn’t work at all. Last year I decided to get a part time retail job considering I had to do something. I had plans to go to University last year as well but due to a mental breakdown and also the stress of my first job and everything I couldn’t go.

Here I am now for a place to study Games Design at University this September and I really need to make a final decision on whether it is worth going or not. I basically have two options. I can either go to University and focus on getting my degree for the next few years where I will be living at Uni in student accommodation, or if I decide not to go to Uni I will have to get full time retail work, either by quitting my current part time retail job and getting a full time retail job, or by keeping my current part time retail job but also getting a 2nd retail job in order to work enough hours for enough money to be able to move out of my parents house. Those are my only options.

Part of me is telling me to go to Uni and get a degree because it will open up better job opportunities for higher paying jobs and retail and any other lower end jobs aren’t really secure enough. The thought of working in retail for the rest of my life is daunting and although most customers have been nice to me, retail is just not something I can imagine myself staying in for the rest of my life.

However, on the other hand, I’ve lost a lot of interest in games over the recent years. I basically never play them anymore and I honestly find them quite boring. I know designing games is different to playing them but in order to design games I kind of need to have an interest and a passion in them otherwise I’m just going to be bored. If that’s the case, it most likely won’t be worth 4 years of my life and the student debt which comes with it.. I will probably end up dropping out due to boredom.

This is honestly one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make in my entire life.

10m3jj1,1674769711,Depression in Early Childhood,True,"Hey you all. I am female, 21yo, and I'll share a bit about my depression with you.

It makes sense to start with my childhood. I grew up with my parents until I was 19. My father had a humble life in his hometown, and in his time, with his financial conditions, he had no option to finish his studies, so he had to move to a big city at the age of 11 and start working.

When he was older, he started traveling through work. He did this for many years, and when he was 48-49, he met my mother, who was 18-19, in her hometown. He was there for work, and she worked at the hotel where he stayed.

My mother grew up in this town, which is also rural and small. She was abandoned by her mother when she was still a baby and raised by her grandmother until she died when my mother was ten years old. From then on, she had to go live with her father. This father was misogynistic, rude, and cruel. He had a roadside bar and put my mother on when she was 11. She then started drinking at that age and developed an alcoholism that has endured to the present day.

My father recognized a lot of her problems when they first met and brought her to the big city so they could start a new life. So she got pregnant with me, I was born, and they were formally married.

Growing up, my parents were evangelicals. I mostly attended church with my mother, and she was always much more present. She was more careful and attentive to me, whereas my father was reclusive and withdrawn. Things started to get worse when my mom started exposing me (I was 5, I think) to cases of her cheating. I was so confused because I knew it was wrong. She emphasized that I couldn't tell my dad. In my head, if I told her, she would leave me; if I didn't, he would leave me, so I remained inert and never did anything.

When I was 8/9 years old, my father discovered some affairs, and I witnessed many fights, sadness, and suffering. I'm not quite sure of the order of events, as they were numerous and severe. I have memories of attending my mother's dates with her lovers, having to take nude pictures of her so she could send them to her virtual lovers, and also watching her have sex via webcam with digital partners.

In parallel with this, I also witnessed alcoholism. She frequently ordered me to fetch her alcoholic drink in bars, markets, greengrocers, and the like. She has a reaction to alcohol that is unlike anything I've ever seen. She gets highly aggressive and violent. She says very nasty things, and she is capable of real hurt (verbally and physically). These terrible reactions mark commemorative dates, weekends, trips, and family events, and I developed trauma from attending these events because of the memories I have attached to them.

When I was ten years old, my father hired a detective and got evidence that my mother was cheating on him with a military policeman who attended our church, was married and had a family. In addition, she had another virtual lover who coincidentally resided in her hometown. She spoke to him daily on the phone, via webcam, and via MSN (at that time). My father tapped the phone; there were recordings of the conversations and pictures of physical dates. Nowadays, when I stop to think about what he went through just then, my heart hurts a lot because I have no idea how devastating this must be.

My father showed all the evidence to my mother, and she had no choice but to admit everything she had been living. This situation happened in my presence, and as if that wasn't traumatic enough, my father asked her if I knew of instances of her cheating. She answered him yes. A great disappointment seized him, and he felt betrayed by me, who was just a child. He expected me to tell him. From that day forward, he saw me as my mother's accomplice for a long time, and we developed an enormous affective distance that impacted me deeply, which I intend to address later in this report.

This series of events culminated in their divorce, and I moved towns with my mother to live with her digital lover, and in that move, they were going to meet in person for the first time.

\[Yes, I know how negligent that sounds...\]

In my country (Brazil), there are many ""favelas"" places of illegal residential occupation, where a class of low socioeconomic power predominates and where ailments, miseries, and violence are concentrated. I went to live in a favela, which was located in a rural area, so it was a massive hill with a lot of home invasions. The houses were simple and humble and built in places with the enormous risk of collapsing with rains in natural tragedies.

This place was also full of nature, animals of different species, some wild, like snakes. My mother's virtual lover lived with his parents and two brothers in this house. We lived with seven people in a humble and small place, where resources were scarce, so in a short time, this became a big problem for my mother and me since everything she brought as a result of her work was voraciously consumed without replacement. There were countless coexistence conflicts when living there.

During this period, I think I was able to experience depression for the first time at the age of 10. I'm sure I had recurrent sadness and melancholy before that, but everything was just abysmal in that period. I didn't have access to entertainment because they didn't have a TV, I couldn't trust people, I felt distressed by everything that had affected my life and my family, and finally, the terrifying feeling of loneliness dominated me.

During this period, I remember that the band Duran Duran came to Brazil to do a show, and their music caught my attention on television. In particular, ""Save a Prayer"". I started listening to much melancholic music from the 80s, even influenced by my mother, who always liked to listen.

My father called me sometimes, and over time, life there was so bad and disgusting that I asked him to come and get me because I felt that I couldn't stand living there any longer. In the meantime, my mother's relationship with her digital lover, now her partner, was becoming increasingly toxic and abusive. They had many problems linked to jealousy, low confidence, alcohol, and disagreements. One time, she was very drunk, and for some reason, she went to hit me, and her partner hit her when he saw that. I don't remember if it was a punch or a slap in the face. She reports that he hit her on her leg in another fight. She was also violent and would go on him a few times. After that occasion with the face, she decided that she would return to São Paulo, where we lived with my father. My father agreed to accept her back, but until then, everything was very uncertain because I didn't know if it was a reconciliation or if I was going to live with her somewhere else.

During that return, it became apparent to me that they weren't exactly ""done"". My mother had a phone conversation with her virtual lover during our trip back to São Paulo, during the whole trip. And they continued to have a long-distance relationship for quite some time, and I would say, for another two years after we returned to São Paulo.

Coming back was a relief because I didn't want to be in that place anymore. When we arrived at the bus station, my father's appearance was heart-wrenching. He was very thin, much thinner than he already was—big beard, careless, and looking much older than he was.

Upon receiving my mother, he established rules so that they could live together again. She had trouble dealing with his reaction, but he was expected to be tough, given everything they'd been through. For me, relief and hope that it was just a bad nightmare filled me. Simple things like being able to watch television excited me a lot.

I didn't understand much about what happened to me until I started attending a school that year. I entered after the start of the class period because I was studying in the other city where I lived. It was difficult to be welcomed by the students. It was a peripheral school attended by other children/pre-adolescents who came from a family and socioeconomic context that was also unstructured and influenced by bad things, so the general climate was one of disobedience, rebellion, reproducing the violence of family life at school, with the teachers and classmates. This scared me a lot because I wasn't used to it, and at first, I cried at school during classes because the environment was very chaotic, and I started to realize how sensitive, sad and different I was...

Over time, my attitude has changed. I think we seek to adapt to the contexts in which we are placed. I became rebellious. I wanted to be popular, to stand out. I wanted the other students to like me. I wanted to be pretty. I wanted to have a boyfriend. I decided, aged 11 that I even wanted to lose my virginity. It didn't happen, but it almost did.

It was a difficult time, and many feelings surfaced simultaneously, such as a lack of affection and many traumas. I was looking to be accepted and loved by others, as is our natural tendency in some settings and ages, but I was certainly out of the ""normal dose"" of that.

I will delve into these aspects of preadolescence and adolescence further, so this post can only focus on aspects of childhood and the transition from childhood to adolescence.

I tried to summarize and exemplify well the events of my parental upbringing that marked me forever and are the pillars of my formation as a human being. I cited my parents' evangelical beliefs and habits, which is important. I never managed to develop faith as a child or teenager because everyday life was so contradictory to Christian commandments, their concepts, and their ""image"" of holiness as superior people who deserve heaven that I concluded to be great hypocrisy, an escape to deny one's faults by attributing them to the devil...

Having gone through these situations is so strong that I don't know how to look at my childhood without remembering it, and I don't know how to hide it. It is latent, and I make an exhaustive effort to deal with it, not exactly to overcome it, but perhaps to reframe and expose myself less day-to-day with regard to these personal experiences.

I am doomed with an endless sense of guilt, which started there at my earliest age, thinking that I had some power to prevent a family tragedy. The fact of knowing and not telling, the role of being an accomplice, being codependent on alcoholism, witnessing continuous fights and violence, and so many lies, I am aware, maybe not how much, but I certainly know that this imprisoned me. I need to fight every day with guilt. Not just these, but a whole mechanism formed that makes me feel guilty for things that I am sometimes suffering from someone else. As if I might be able to bypass everything, control everything. I feel guilty even feeling guilty because I can't help it, and I hear a lot that ""I need to stop blaming myself"". Needing to stop blaming myself, I repeat this to myself and am frustrated that I can't.

The mechanism of extreme self-blame is aggressive, corrodes us from within, and can push us to the limit.

If you also went through something similar, know that there are people in the world who understand you. Not 100%, because this is always non-transferable, individual. This disease is cruel. Society doesn't understand, our bosses don't understand, our colleagues and partners often don't understand, it's easy to feel WEAK for something that unintentionally affects you, like the feeling of guilt, which you know shouldn't be there, but it is, as well as the ongoing sadness of depression.

They want to end it in a few months &amp; have distanced themselves for this reason. There is something they &amp; I know would help but unfortunately that means losing most of what they have (materialistic) and their not willing to do that. Their family doesn’t know about this either as it’s hard enough for them to come to me but I feel like if they did they would understand and not force them to lose what they have to be happy. Something I’ve wondered is if it’s not totally unreasonable for me to tell one of their family members how they feel and what they want to do as they still live with their parents &amp; I know they would try to help if they knew but I don’t feel that’s my place but if nothings done their probably gonna end it.

10m3a8n,1674769086,Wie ich mich fühle.,True,"Hallo, mein Name ist Zaqat ihr magt mich nicht kennen aber ich möchte dennoch gerne über mich und meine Gefühle reden. Als Kind war ich schon sehr laut da ich nach Aufmerksamkeit sehnte, das schon im alter von 6. Ich wurde in der 2. Klasse fett, meinen Kameraden hat es nicht gestört außer paar die sehr fies zu mir waren, aber am meisten waren es die aus der Pararelklasse, die mich deshalb gemobbt hatten. Ich hatte in der Grundschule nur 3 Freunde und ich kann euch sagen dass waren die besten Freunde die ich je hatte, Es waren Maximilian, Ben und Yasin, sie waren immer für mich da aber leider trennten sich unsere Wege nach der 4. In den Sommerferien (2016) wurde ich schlagartig dünn, ich verlor innerhalb 2 wochen 25kg. (ich war damals 10, 1.60 und 65 kilo, und wurde aus dem nicht 40kg) Ich war ersts glücklich da ich endlich wieder mal dünn war aber als ich in die 5. Eingeschult wurde, wurde mir oft gesagt dass ich zu dünn war und mein Kopf groß wäre, ich war wieder zerstört ich dachte mir als 10 jähriger nur warum, warum werde ich fürs dick sein gemobbt und danach fürs dünn sein gemobbt. Dies ging weiter bis meine Mobber endlich die Schule verlassen mussten wegen Verweisen etc. Ich wurde mit 13 wieder dick (1.82 84kg) ich hab mich in meinem leben noch nie so hässlich gefühlt gehabt wie in dieser Zeit da ich fett war und Haarausfall hatte wegen Neurodermitis, mein Neurodermitis ging auf meine Kopfhaut und ich verlor sehr viele Haare deswegen. Ich war immer sehr traurig und hab meine traurigkeit leider in wut umgewandelt und diese Emotion denen abgelassen die es eigentlich nicht verdient hatten, was mich noch mehr traurig machte. Es stellte sich heraus dass ich eine Magendarm entzündung hatte weswegen ich mit 10 abnormal zugenommen hatte. Ich musste mehrmals ins Krankenhaus und bekam mit 14 die Krankheit Realitätsverlust. Ab dem Zeitpunkt war Corona, Quarantäne und 2 monate Krankenhaus angesagt. Ich hab mich tot gefühlt innerlich und wusste nicht wie ich damit umgehen soll. Mit 13 hatte ich eine dicke ausseinandersetzung gehabt mit meiner Familie, ich wurde in meinem Zimmer eingesperrt und sollte mich beruhigen, ich war noch mehr sauer und traurig und suchte nach einer Schere um mich selber umzubringen, da in mir ein trigger ausgelöst wurde. Als ich keine Schere gefunden habe legte ich mich nach 5 minuten wieder hin, als ich mich hinlag, sah ich rechts neben mir die Schere die ich so lange gesucht habe, ich fing an zu weinen da ich mir dachte wozu das alles. Mit 15 wurde alles besser zum glück ich bekam mein Glow-up, hatte sehr viele Freunde und war beliebt in meiner Klasse und in meinem Jahrgang. Das war die beste Erinnerung aber als sich die 10. langsam zum Ende näherte merkte ich wie die meisten sich geändert haben, mein alter „bester Freund“ hatte mich gehasst wegen einem Mädchen was mich sehr verletzt hatte ich versuchte oft mit ihm zu reden aber nichts klappte. Juli 2022 hab ich ein Bruchteil meiner Freunde verloren aber ich hatte noch meine „echten“ Freunde an meiner Seite. Neue Schule neues Glück, meine Klasse war nicht so cool wie meine alte und sie war sehr rassistisch, vorallem gegenüber mir, ich muss leichten rassismus ertragen obwohl ich nur zu 25% Schwarz bin. Selbst mein „echter Freund“ der mit mir in der Klasse ist, hatte sich oft rassistisch geäußert und mich als N wort beleidigt. Ich brach mit ihm den Kontakt ab und der erzählte meinen Freunden eine andere Geschichte die komplett gelogen war aber sie haben ihm geglaubt und mich ebenfalls fallen gelassen. Ich verlor ende 2022 alles und bin jetzt nun in 2023 alleine, ich spiele mittlerweile 16 jahre alt und spiele Basketball in der Landesliga, Basketball ist meine einzige beschäftigung da ich keine Freunde habe und immer alleine bin außer mit der Mannschaft natürlich. Grad fühle ich mich komplett scheiße und alleine aber ich hoffe das bessere Zeiten kommen werden.

Ich würde euch gerne Fragen, ist es verkehrt keine Freunde zu haben und kommt noch das Sinn des Lebens?",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10m3a8n/wie_ich_mich_fühle/,Ok_Marketing1719,

Depression, even in these times, is still somewhat of a taboo topic to discuss. It’s definitely becoming more acceptable to talk about in a public manner; however, there’s still a stigma to it. I’ve got family and friends who don’t believe that you can get depression. That it’s just all in your head, or you’re being a “sissy” about your feelings. Why can’t you just be happy? I was at that standpoint in my life once upon a time as well. I had family that had these issues and I just always thought, “why don’t you just get over yourself and enjoy life?” I know now, it’s not that simple. Depression is also something that nobody else can truly understand unless they’ve experienced it. Even then, they still don’t have your feelings and your coping skills. They don’t have the same willpower that you have. They can’t process the emotions in how you’re designed to process them. That’s what makes depression a unique issue to try and solve. It’s not like a regular disease there there’s a one in all pill that you can take that makes everything go away. For some, there is, but for most, it’s a battle of their own, and sadly sometimes not everyone is able to win their own battle.

There are on average 132 suicides per day in the USA according to recent research conducted in 2020. In 2020, 45,979 Americans lost their lives to suicide. Also in that same year, there were 1.2 million suicide attempts that thankfully didn’t result in death. Suicide is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States and the highest suicide rate is in middle-aged white men. That has led to 3.88x men dying to suicide more than women.  With those numbers, it’s believed, according to that same recent survey conducted by the Harris Poll, that Americans believe that 93% of suicides could be prevented. All of these, statistics, pertain solely to the United States alone, so one of those 1.20 million suicide attempts that failed, easily could’ve been one of your co-workers, a family member, or even just a neighbor in your community. Trust me, hiding attempts from people is easier than you might think. Again, this is where depression becomes the incognito killer. You honestly never know who is battling depression and also how severe it is until something tragic like this is attempted. 

Depression, from my viewpoint, is basically your body telling yourself, I don’t want this anymore. It’s not telling you to end your life, it’s telling you to change the person you are at this time and end that cycle of hurt you’re currently living in. Something has to come to an end, but your life should never be the answer. It’s so hard to look for answers to questions that you haven’t even heard yet. It’s hard to speak out whenever you can’t find the words to say. It feels like you’re just a shadow in the dark. It feels like walls are constantly closing in on you. It feels like the pressure of anxiety could cave your chest in. That’s what getting help with depression is like, and for some, those hurdles seem to make it impossible for them to reach out sadly. Even though it feels like there aren’t any answers in sight, you have to start those baby steps and seek those answers in order to get help to prevent you from being just another number, another statistic, another hole in the ground. Statistically, I’m supposed to be just another statistic of this. Actually, I’m supposed to have either already died or been incarcerated just going off of my background and the data that’s been collected in surveys over the years. That’s not bragging, and I’ve still got a lot I want to do to change myself and the lives of people around me, that’s me stating the fact and also saying that you don’t have to become a number. You don’t have to let your past, illness, status quo, etc define you. You don’t have to live in that darkness and live in that hopeless valley.  You truly are given the tools within yourself and have the ability to change things. You can’t ever change your past, but you can work on controlling your future. 

Reaching out for help is the greatest thing you’ll ever tackle whenever you’re battling depression. Something so simple as saying “I need help” is the greatest hurdle you’ll ever face in your life. You think people will think you’re crazy or that you’re not capable of being a productive member of society, you’ll have to be on pills forever, and yeah those thoughts are true and in certain issues are valid. The first time I reached out for help and began therapy, I felt like a total nut-job to put it lightly. Only “crazy” people have to go to therapy is what I would tell myself, and that’s simply not true. I was young and I was also confused about how to even begin to tackle depression. In fact, it would probably surprise you more about the kind of people that are engaged with therapy as opposed to those who aren’t. When I got the balls to reach out for help and begin my true journey to bettering myself, there were still a lot of dark times. Bringing up some old traumas that you’ve suppressed and also taking medications that can make you feel numb, or more depressed than when you started them. But when you do take those steps, and you go through those trials, you’ll notice the progress and change. It doesn’t happen overnight and take sometimes takes a while, but eventually, you will discover a better you. I know that I have, and if a knucklehead like me can go through it and come out better, anyone can.

Now once you get help, that doesn’t mean everything is magically cured and you’ll never face depression again. A seasonal change, a traumatic event, a financial strain, anything it seems can cause you to fall right back into that darkness, but what’s important is when you do fall into that darkness, you know how to climb out. It might not be instantly getting out of the darkness, but you’ll be prepared with new tools and coping skills that will allow you to get out of the darkness.  You take those coping skills and realize and remember that the darkness isn’t permanent.  I actually think it hits harder after you’ve had so much rejuvenated joy and wonder come back into your life that once that’s tampered with, you mourn the loss of it. You miss what you had and also you feel like you’ve let yourself down and that you’ve destroyed all the progress you’ve made, but that’s far from the truth. There are no magical words or crystal balls that will make it go away, but there are tools to help battle it. The key truly is identifying when you’ve fallen back into that darkness because sometimes it happens without you even noticing. The slow descent becomes the norm and you’re back to where you were, only worse off sometimes. I at least know that’s the case with me. Then you slowly lose those coping skills and you’re almost back down to one.

After I got the help and bettered myself, I felt untouchable. I truly felt like anything was possible, and overall I began to see that life really is beautiful. I gained more self-confidence and I was just killing life to put it simply. Then…BOOM!!! I’m hit with a new traumatic event in my life, and it truly threw me deeper into depression than I’ve ever experienced. I thought at first it was just accepting the loss of something you truly held as your lifeline, but then, that sadness wouldn’t go away. The sadness became my new norm. In time, I realized how long I had been in this funk and had fallen into the darkness. It had become the norm. That darkness of depression was my mood all day every day. No matter how much I laughed, listened to music, or hung out with friends, at the end of the night, there was a little voice in the back of my head that kept casting self-doubt. It kept telling me that I wasn’t good enough, I didn’t deserve happiness, and I was just wasting space. I hadn’t heard that voice of self-doubt in so long, but it was basically shouting at me and actually making me lose all of the coping skills I had developed and was utilizing daily. Pretty soon, I quit seeing the sun. I started feeling empty. I started feeling anxious all the time. I just overall felt hopeless and numb. Once you get that low, you start getting closer to rock bottom, you start tempting yourself more and more with tools of destruction 

For me, my escape was becoming alcohol. I was having to get high, just to feel a little dull. At least I was feeling something whenever I was getting intoxicated. It was nothing but sadness, but it let me know that I could still feel something. This wasn’t a nightly occurrence, never affected my work life, and never made me not reliable for paying bills and such, but it did start helping me lose touch with people who were close to me. Those people could actually help me out of this situation. I felt ashamed of myself, too much to reach out to them. After I had conquered depression and it had subsided for some time, how could I go back to them and tell them I fell into another situation? I also felt ashamed because somewhere along the way, I lost my personal beliefs.  I used to think that I was all I ever needed. I was good enough and I could do anything I wanted to.  When the alcohol started making me feel, I began to feel nothing but worthless and sad. I was mourning the loss of something that meant everything to me. My morals and to a degree, my mindset. It’s possible to drink yourself to death, but I never thought of it as a means to an end. I almost felt like it was a vitamin I was taking just to get by until the next time I needed another escape out of the numbness. I didn’t like facing the demons, but they sickeningly reminded me that I could feel something, anything.  

When the alcohol wasn’t doing it anymore, I needed something else. Something more than would allow me to take control of the situation. That’s where cutting quickly became an issue of mine. It’s still a struggle at times because, with that blade in your hand, you can finally control how much pain you feel. It’s all about being in control when your life is in a whirlwind. You sometimes can’t fully control the situation you’re in currently in life, so if you want that control, it’s easy to resort to cutting. Sometimes I would look forward to it, the rush of controlling the pain. It’s sick to think about now and overall a tragic coping skill for anyone to develop, but here I was with a box cutter slashing away at my body. I was doing something I never thought I was capable of but I also was feeling a darkness that I wasn’t ever expecting to hit me the way it did. Sometimes it’s just too hard to remember that it’s always darkest before dawn. That after that darkness, the sun will come up and brighten the day. It clears away all of that darkness. It doesn’t work in real-world time and as I mentioned earlier. It can take weeks, months, or even years. But the sun does eventually come out and you’ll be in a full clear view of how beautiful life is and how amazing the future can be.

Sadly, cutting isn’t as far as the darkness would take me. Eventually, I’d start tempting my fine. I’d mix whatever different pills I had, sleep medication, anti-depressants, etc with alcohol. HOW FUCKING STUPID IS THAT?! Whenever I started doing this, life almost became meaningless. I was just a hollow shell going through the motions waiting to feel. I could go out in public, make people laugh and smile, I’d do my work and even chores, but then I’d get home and hear nothing but silence. Eventually, this combination just didn’t do anything for me anymore, and sometimes, I couldn’t just get these damn wrists to bleed. I’d just keep adding more and more and no changes would happen. Eventually, I would get testier with my tools of destruction. The next step after cutting was I had a weight-lifting device in the home and I would begin slowly hanging myself from the weight-lifting device. I knew it could hold well over 200 lbs, so I figured it could surely hold me for long enough. The first time I wrapped it around my neck, I got that rush of control. I had found a new way to control the hurt. I leaned forward and just started choking myself essentially with my body weight with the weight strap tied around my neck. I did that until I got dizzy and hazy. I saw the darkness coming in slowly out of the corner of my eyes.  It scared me because I thought I wouldn’t be able to get stable in time to not suffocate myself to death. I remember thanking God and wanting to change my ways and my views of life after I was able to pull myself up. That meaning of life for me lasted for less than a day and I was back mixing whatever stimulants I could find and I just kept going into the night. Eventually one night, I got a feeling. The feeling was overwhelming sadness. There was that shadow of doubt hanging over my head, telling me I’d be better off dead. I didn’t deserve to live. I was just like my family. When that realization hit, I wrote out a note to a loved one and apologized for everything I had done. I still have the note and look at it as a reminder. A reminder how of irrational you can be and within a moment, how that one thought has caused you to take your own life. It’s truly tragic and just horrible people get to that level. To the level, I was sinking deeper and deeper into.

The night that shadow of doubt got cast over me, I decided it was time. I put the note on the table and began finding a way that I couldn’t back out. I was going to raise the weight-lifting device a few more notches up and wrap it around my neck a few more times. Even if I sat down or tried to get the strap unwrapped around my neck, it’d probably be too late. I’d still end up suffocating. With a final swig of liquid courage, I got the balls to initiate the process. As I started watching the world around me grow darker and I felt my body become number, I felt the life coming out of me. Suddenly I was given a burst of life. I felt so many emotions rush through me all within a few seconds. I saw my life just playing so fast right before my eyes. The main thing I thought was life-changing was I actually could feel again. I wasn’t hollow anymore. The numbness had gone away and the darkness cleared away and I instantly just had the energy and hindsight to stop what I was doing and realize that I had so much more to give to the universe and I had so much more life to live. After I finally got untangled, I just laid on the cold floor and worked on catching my breath. After that, I just became inconsolable. I cried until it hurt to cry. Just sitting on the floor and bawling, letting those primal emotions out.  I thanked God for the changes in my heart and for filling me up once again. I also thanked myself for having mercy on myself to see that I needed change and from that moment on, I was willing to change. That’s the key when depression hits is having the will to change. Easier said than done, but fully possible. 

We all have a purpose. No matter how small or how grand you feel, everything you do to other people or whatever you put out into the universe causes a chain reaction in not only your life but the lives of others around you as well. Some people think if you’re not rich or famous, you can’t make a difference but that’s so far from the truth. I know I was put here to make others happy and to make others laugh. I just have that ability. For just a few moments out of the day, I have the ability to make people forget their worries, issues, bills, whatever, and just have a laugh and a time to forget all of that stuff. It’s those moments of making people laugh and changing their outlook on things for even a few moments in the day, that can lead to changing their mood for the rest of the day. Who knows, that person you made laugh could’ve cried themselves to sleep the previous night. They could also be going through depression and getting swallowed up in that darkness, but within that moment, maybe you helped change their outlook. Not saying it’s saving lives, or makes you a saint, but I truly believe that what you put out into the universe, can be infectious with the people that you surround yourself with. I know whenever I’ve been caught up in that darkness, sometimes a silly joke just reminds me that there are joys in this life and there is a light that can shine out of the darkness. Even if it is brief, it shows there’s a beacon of hope. 

That’s not to say it’s ever easy to make jokes with people or to act silly to make them smile whenever you’re in that darkness. Bringing a smile to someone else is easy for me, bringing a smile to myself can at times feel impossible. Hiding behind a faded smile is the easiest thing I’ve ever done in my life.  That’s where you have to focus on yourself and within yourself to realize you are bringing joy to others, so you need to bring that joy to yourself. Realize you matter. Realize you can make a difference, and also realize that life is beautiful. It really and truly is. Life is a gift, but it won’t wait for you. You’ve got to go power through the grief, the hurt, the darkness, the worries, the doubts, and the insecurities and reach out to take life in. Breathe it in and enjoy it. Get high off of life instead of the toxic shit you can put in your body.  You win life whenever you reach out and embrace yourself and realize you’re a rock star and you can make positive impacts on others. You’re truly invincible whenever you embrace yourself. The gift is right there, so why wouldn’t you take it? It costs nothing to reach out and take it, but it can cost your life if you leave it sitting there.  Always remember, life won’t wait for you.  Don’t get caught up in a moment that wasn’t meant to last. Take care of yourself because you really do matter and you can put something wonderful out to the universe if you truly want to.

In many way last I had a fortunate start, born in to a middle class family and have been able to make not friends, not to speak to about things I am posting here, but I haven’t been totally alone. The issues I have is that I wear a mask, or a personality day to day that is likeable, kind, understanding and engaging, but this is all a facade. 

A number of years ago, on a family holiday and absolutely wankered, I fell out with my family and stayed too long at the bar (the kind that only served a southern fired chicken wrap andr encourages you to try their special shot (4 spirits once downed before you suck the lighted fumes through a straw) On the walk to the hotel, I was walking backwards down a hill taking a piss (my brother and I had done this every night of hol, I am ashamed to say). The night I walked home alone, I was bludgeoned around the head with a rock and proceeded to be strangled and subsequently raped. I’m fortunate I think to have been semi conscious, I really can’t recall a lot after the initial pain/horror. By lack of oxygen or by some instinctive reflex I have blacked the incident. I buried this deep for many years until latent onset ptsd took hold. The following years can best be described as an industrial consumption of cocaine (roughly 2g per day, 2oz per month), a oz weed pm, alcohol - half bottle of gin per day and prescription meds (sertraline &amp; diazepam). I had a mental breakdown, was off work many months during which my girlfriend left me.

I blew my inheritance, everything my father broke himself to work hard for(he doesn’t know). The guilt and shame is unbearable. 

I am now sober one year and two weeks. My only source of pride.

I moved home recently (after 10 years living in London) to care for my mum who has Alzheimer’s. Despite all of the therapy I have done regarding ptsd, eating disorders etc I still feel so broken and unable to focus (I should add I also have adhd- yet to receive medication.

I’ve always fantasised about suicide, but I’m acutely aware that I am now forming specific plans of how to end my life. I’ll be frank, I am scared of what I may be about to do. 

I feel very scared to post this, but I really would appreciate any advice from those familiar with similar rabbit holes.

10m1abi,1674764088,I hate dogs,True,"My family are dog breeders (rottweilers) it's one of the nicest, stressful, fun and amazing things I can think of.

I cannot say I've lost too many in my life as I'm not particularly old enough to experience that much (18). But ive lost enough to not want to have a pet later in life because of it. I've been in the puppy bed helping the bitch with the birthing process I've stayed awake for days only getting 2-4 hour sleeps in between to make sure the pups are safe 100% of the time I've watched them grow before my eyes and I've seen the ones I'd loved the most slow down struggle to get up wimper from moving just so they could sit with me and I was with as many as I could be with in there final moments watching there eyes close.

We've taken in lots of ""problem dogs"" aswell and turned them into some of the best in our kennal from some that couldn't calm down to some that were aggressive to people we put so much time into our dogs I've barely got time for anything else in my life (lol) we've made dogs that came into the kennal hairs up currled in the corner snarling come out crying to get a hug and kiss to play wrestling in the grass.

I've been the happiest I've ever been with these dogs I've played for hours at a time I've walked up mountains with them we've tracked animals with them I've done everything together. I've also made alot of mistakes too accidentally droping heavy things on their head, telling them of too much and being the reason for a few fights aswell.

These next coming years will be the hardest I'll ever experience a lot of our dogs are within a similar age bracket from 7-9. Rottweilers have a tendency not to get much past 9. It's just began and I already don't know what to do with myself two of my old dogs passed of old age within the same week. Stupidly I've been boiling my emotions into being productive doing better in school trying harder at the gym being more social and trying to work as much as possible. But every time I see a old or limping dog or any kind of ill effecting condition I feel so sad I almost start crying on the buss.

I don't want to cry about it not because I'm a man not because I'm embarrassed not because i don't think it works . But because I see no reason to cry I don't see how it helps I'm sad why cry though? It doesn't serve any purpose or help to me except draw attention to myself when i don't want it the most.

On a final note as this will become WAYY too long I've been told its a terrible idea to not help someone I'd they are upset or struggling but if I feel upset and someone asks if I'm upset or can tell and is trying to get me to ""upen up"" it irritates me to no end I've been told in this situation I go from looking ""hollow"" to being almost ""frightening"" within a few sentences.

10m0q0o,1674762683,Tired of climbing back up the mountain again,True,"As a background, I’ve had Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features for the last several years. It’s kind of similar to bipolar disorder with mixed episodes. I’ve been hospitalized several times for this but for the most part I manage it OK.

If you look back in my post history, I do a lot of art. I do a lot of things, really….I have a full time job that’s rewarding and challenging. I’m a mom and my family lives close. I have a masters degree but I’m pursuing a second bachelor’s in psychology. I volunteer at a crisis hotline, I play music. I’m an advocate for mental health both through my art and also in my volunteer work and as a mental health peer support specialist.

In November I suddenly fell into a severe mixed depression. I was struggling with a project at work and it tugged at my insecurities, and seasonal depression started to rear its head too, and then I went 3 days without sleep and it kicked My mental illness into high gear. As my therapist said, it “checked every box”. I stopped eating and lost weight rapidly, stopped sleeping but zoned out in bed, racing thoughts, couldn’t watch my daughter or go to work or even hold a conversation. My mental health team was alarmed. 

After about a week of every-other-day conversations with my therapist, I decided this bullshit wasn’t going to ruin my Thanksgiving and I just…got over it. Just like that. Total, the episode lasted about two weeks. I decorated for Christmas. Things seemed OK or at least tolerable.

Then on December 22, I got into a major car accident, resulting in a totaled car and concussion. A week later, I got COVID and it hit me hard. I could barely get out of bed, and completely 100% lost my voice for several weeks. Somewhere in the middle of all of this, my region got hit with the largest snowstorm it had ever seen. I was completely isolated, voiceless, unable to even leave my bed and without the ability to leave my home. Dozens of people died. I felt helpless. The condition of my house deteriorated. I ignored phone calls from friends (because my voice wasn’t working anyway). I regularly forgot to take my psychiatric meds, a problem I’m still having. I would classify this as unipolar depression, because I’m sleeping fine (or even too much) and not having racing thoughts.

Finally, last week, I went to work for the first time in almost a month. I’m so happy to be back to work. But I’m exhausted. And behind. It just feels like sliding down a mountain and having to climb back up. I haven’t done any volunteer work with my crisis line since before the accident. I just can’t bring myself to be that bedrock. I can’t make art other than one abstract painting of the car accident. All I can manage is the minimum of making sure my daughter feels cared for, and going in to work. The rest of the time I spend in bed. I’m a passionate owner of plants and most of my plants are suffering at this point. A couple have died from lack of watering.

Things have been sliding since that depressive episode in November and the hits just keep coming. As I told my therapist, I know I can climb out of this. I’m just sick of doing it.

I do not have the mental strength to make any lasting change in my life. Meaningful, positive change for me feels so far out of the realm of possibility that it might as well be a fictional concept. Scraping together the motivation to do healthful things is exhausting, and inevitably after days or weeks or months, I fall off the track and go back to my old habits, and stay there for a long time before eventually making another feeble attempt. I try my best, or at least I try to try my best (how can I even tell?), but I’ve always felt useless, lazy, and underachieving. What is natural and easy to so many people is a constant battle for me, and I always lose.

It’s too tiring to brush my teeth twice a day, it’s tiring to brush my teeth once a day (but I do at least that much), it’s too tiring to exercise every day, it’s too tiring to exercise once a week, it’s too tiring to go outside on a walk or otherwise, it’s too tiring to buy and prepare and eat healthy food, it’s tiring to buy and prepare and eat any food at all (but I have to, to survive), it’s too tiring to drink enough water consistently, it’s too tiring to bathe and shave myself every day (I only consistently manage it every third day), it’s too tiring to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and go to bed and wake up on time, it’s too tiring to remember to take breaks from the computer to stretch my spine and hands. And of course that is all just taking care of bodily health, on top of which are so many other responsibilities and tasks. 

It’s too tiring for me to make consistent effort towards long-term goals or even goals of any kind, and every new attempt at a plan or schedule, no matter how earnest, quickly falls apart. It’s tiring even to make an occasional token attempt at doing the things that I’m passionate about and that are meaningful to me.

Everything is so tiring, and I struggle to do even the bare minimum. This has been my entire life, it’s just how my brain has always been wired. I don’t enjoy life.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10m0hmp/all_things_are_tiring/,WaitingSomewhere,

10lzaw7,1674759174,How do I get better?,True,"So for starters I’ve been clinically diagnosed with anxiety and severe clinical depression since I was 19. 
I’m currently 27F. 

Back in 2021 of August my dad and I tested positive for COVID. 
He ended up passing away due to COVID complications.
He was my best friend and the only family member that believed in me and gave me emotional support. 

I became deeply depressed, some time went by and in 2022, one year of his death- my grandma, his mom, dies. She died of natural causes and that resurfaced a lot of pain that I noticed I didn’t properly heal from. 

About a week ago, my kitten passed away and I did everything I could to get her the proper care. 

I feel like I’m back at square one if not worse. 

I’m starting to not find an interest in anything I do. I disconnected with most of my friends. It’s harder for me to socialize with people. 

I tried going shopping yesterday, and I couldn’t. I sat in my car crying because I felt overwhelmed to go inside. 

Everything, even the smallest tasks I feel frozen. I tried getting help but I find it difficult to do so. 

also at times I feel overwhelmed to leave my house.

10ly823,1674756439,"Will I ever get through this, or do things just keep getting worse?",True,"I always see and hear of people getting great opportunities to work and travel, live a life that has meaning and at least some enjoyment. I lost my mom, went through a horrible break up, was nearly crippled for life, then lost my job and have since been just struggling to survive and make ends meet. 

I am fairly well educated, but no matter how hard I try to find a job that will free me of the crippling financial situation I am in, it just seems like a pipe dream. I am proud of myself for surviving this long in the face of adversity, but I feel like a shadow of my former self. 

Now in my 30s, I feel that I will never have the chance to study further or be able to live a life that doesn't feel like a constant circling of the drain. I keep thinking about my mom, and how she had hopes and dreams of her own that just evaporated when she got ill suddenly. 

There are so many places I want to go, things I want to do and see - I want to write a book, study more, maybe one day make some contribution to society through science or technology, but I feel trapped. I am stuck in my parents home struggling to make a living, desperate to just be able to stand on my own 2 feet again. I feel like I may do better if I was somewhere else, but how do I even get there when I can't even support myself? Losing my job made me question my self worth, and while I am skilled, I don't seem skilled enough that I am even in demand. Weirdly enough, friends of mine with the very same qualifications were able to find work and emigrate, and are now living much happier lives. They keep encouraging me to apply, and while I do, I have not had much joy - I'm either too old, or ghosted because I live in another country even though I am willing to travel.

On top of all this, I am so very lonely. I can't afford to partake in any recreational or social activities. All I've got is a mountain of debt (a loan I took to study that I am now struggling to pay back) and depression that I've failed to shake. I've been fighting this battle since my early teens - I was bullied a lot, had bad skin, a hard time fitting in, and 

One of the worst things is waking up, feeling incredibly lonely. I look in the mirror and hate what I see. I have terrible health anxiety (probably because I lost my mom to illness) and while I don't want my life to end, I am not enjoying it. I am trying to be grateful for the good things - my siblings, my father, the fact that I have a roof over my head and 3 modest meals a day are all things that many people wish they could have. So I also feel guilty and ungrateful. Most of all, I feel horribly depressed. I feel like I'm too old to find love or any exciting opportunities that would make me feel alive.

Also, I know that emotional numbness is an indicator of depression as well. But I wouldnt say I'm numb, at least I can't recall or officially determine that I've been numb. Although, I've had days where I could sleep all day. Ill spend any waking moment doom scrolling and not have any emotions salient enough for me to remember. Is this what people mean when they feel numb? Or is that just my baseline?

10lxlic,1674754846,Death to a soul...,True,"Life is precious...or so they say. However, society tends to actively dismantle your emotional state of mind and treat you quite the opposite. My soul is dead. After decades of trying my hardest to make my way in life, society...as a whole...has failed miserably. I always say, ""Society has to work with you""  Others say, ""It's all up to you and don't rely on others."" Well...I beg to differ, because you can try your hardest and reach for the stars, but if other people don't see you as worthy of friendship or you are constantly bullied and shoved to the ground...how can you make any measurable gains? If people are constantly antagonistic and demoralize you on a regular basis, how in the hell are you supposed to succeed? 

There is a measure of common decency that should be given to everyone. The people that are fighting actively for the right to life and stopping abortions are thinking at the end of their noses. Once you are born, life sucker punches you and nearly kills you every step of the way. Where are those activist groups then? Yeah...they fought valiantly so that you could live (to make themselves feel better), but at what cost to your soul? Society is a cancerous, disease ridden entity. Once you are born, that so-called precious life is thrown into a blender and destroyed from the inside. 

You absolutely cannot survive life ""alone"". You can't spearhead every endeavor and win....alone. Others have to work with you, help you, encourage you, love you...etc. Even my own family emotionally abandoned me early in life. Here's an analogy for you...let's say you wait tables for a living. You go to work with a great attitude. You are well versed on all the menus options. You spend your day smiling and making small talk and giving great service. Your uniform is clean and neat. Your personal hygiene is managed well. At the end of the day, nobody tipped you. You have nothing to show for your hard work and diligent effort. You did your part.. right? Society failed you. If this type of thing goes on consistently in your life, no matter what restaurant you work in, society has failed you...over and over. The restaurant analogy is just a base line to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. The same goes for every other industry. If people don't buy your goods and services...no matter how awesome your product might be, your business will fail miserably. 

This goes for life in general. If you are always alone, always struggling, always under a heavy weight, always scraping the bottom of the barrel......life seriously sucks. My soul is dead. There's nothing left to try and all I can see are decades of failure and isolation in the future. I hate my parents for giving birth to me. I loath my own existence. I'm screaming for friendship and the world just yells back....""Screw you, you're worthless"". That's why I chose the user name ""unworthy-1"". It's fitting and undeniably true.

This is probably the first time i open up about this (my feelings)

In 2021, i got out of a 3 year relationship to which my ex broke up with me because i cheated about a year in. She has her cons but she was a saint she stayed with me till the end when she really just could not regain her trust for me so it was better if she left. Of course i did not blame her for leaving me as i wasnt a very good partner when i was younger then i can say now ive matured. After the break up i was lost, from having someone i can talk to everyday and having someone to support you emotionally to being completely alone was very tough for me to accept. 
As shortly after the breakup, i needed to serve a conscription for my country for 2 years. It was really the most mentally challenging time in my life. Things would feel better then the next day its like you hit a brick wall again and everything goes back down. Its almost now 2 years since the break where i finally can say I’ve moved on from her but i really can’t seem to forgive myself for what i did. I felt like i hit the jackpot but lost it all on lust. Ive stopped going on dates because the feelings are just not right i feel what if i could never find that love again and is it because i don’t deserve it anymore? That i had my chance and i screwed it up? Ive lost my sense to love. I feel i will never ever be able to forgive myself and its been eating at me mentally, do i even deserve any empathy? I did something wrong and im paying for it now.

This is the first time ive spoken out about it and i don’t know to me its sounds so dumb and petty because i know i don’t deserve any empathy.

10lxft0,1674754452,How to deal with the loneliness and depression?,True,"Hey guys, so I’m 24 and I’m in need of advice. 

I simply don't know what to do anymore. I’ve been suffering from depression for a long time now and sadly it just seems to have amplified over the years. Without going into too much detail, most of my depression stems from things in the past like trauma, childhood abuse, growing up poor, bullying, family deaths etc. 

All my life I’ve been bullied and treated like an outcast and it just eventually becomes too much to handle, leading me to believe that this is who I am going to be all my life. 

They always say to keep trying at life and persevere through your suffering, but what happens if you don’t succeed at anything. It seems like no matter how hard I try to become a better person, overcome my obstacles, and make the few people who care about me proud, I just end up failing in the end. 

Some examples include, trying to make friends but resulting in them backstabbing or leaving me after they realize what a loser I am, trying to get my driver’s license but failing multiple times due to my anxiety, trying to talk to girls but ending up being rejected due to my insecurities and ugly looks etc. 

Honestly the list just goes on. I feel so ashamed of myself to have failed so miserably at life, whether that be socially, romantically and academically. I guess the reason I’m posting this is because while most of me thinks I should resort to suicide to avoid more pain in the future, a tiny part of me hopes that I can turn things around.

My mother has always been extremely overbearing and overreactive. She nags continuously, repeats herself for an hour if she can and if I tell her to stop, she will take it out on my father instead. She will then constantly nag him, dramitize how bad of a daughter I am and this will cause him to lose his patience and get angry with me. He's okay at first, but she constantly harrases him, panics way too much and he has a short temper so he takes it out on me. It's a very dysfunctional cycle which happens at home, which repeats itself. I'm constantly asking my dad if I'm going to be homeless anytime soon, or if I have to leave because I've been threatened with being kicked out before. My mum keeps causing my anxiety, saying I'm going to be kicked out but my dad is denying it.

 She will think I'm lying all the time, always blames me in comparison to my brothers for petty shit that wasn't my fault, I have never lied to her in the past, but she thinks I'm the odd one out because I have issues. She has said very hurtful things to me such as threatening to put me up for adoption, kicking me out, dealt with my panic attacks horrendously. My parents also compare me to people they think are bad, such as my uncle who was literally abusive and a friend's daughter who they see as overweight, sleazy and lazy.

I have never been a bad kid. I was bullied, triggering my panic attacks so I used to be bad with emotions. Other than that, I never did drugs, never slept around or even went out late at night. Yet they always eventually seem to think I'm the bad egg of the family.

Right now I'm looking for work and I have a bit of experience on my CV. I'm finding any ways to make money on the side, so I can get away. I will still have depression, but at least the symptoms won't be triggered by the onslaught of dysfunction that is my family dynamic.

my father has had problems with binge-eating and passed down those unhealthy habits to me. as my mental health has plummeted over the past few years its just gotten worse and worse and worse. its become a bit of a coping mechanism. whenever im in a really bad place I just eat a shit ton of food, feel better in the moment, and then im fucking disgusted with myself after. im doing it less now that ive quit my job and don't have as much money for food, and self harm has kinda replaced binge eating as a coping mechanism. ive tried going to the gym but it ended up costing too much and my parents aren't able to pay for me. ive tried at home workouts but my house is pretty small and there isn't much room, plus I cant wear short sleeves in the house (cuz of the scars) and my parents would get suspicious if im working out in long sleeves indoors. plus after a couple weeks I usually plummet into a bit of a depressive hole and working out becomes pretty much impossible. 

ive started eating less. im trying to stick to one meal a day, but I end up binging at least once a week. ive tried making myself throw up but for some reason I cant. I know I will never be able to be happy until im skinny. its not like im morbidly obese, but im big enough for it to be noticeable. I used to be able to suck in my stomach and sorta look okay, but I cant anymore. nothing ive tried helps. unless I figure out how to starve myself for longer without binging, I think I might be stuck like this forever.

the feeling that im never gonna be able to change this is just adding to my hopelessness. all the more reason to kill myself. no one will ever want to be my friend if im fat.

10lvf1l,1674749457,I can’t support myself,True,"Just a vent, sorry I’m on mobile. 
I was initially diagnosed with depression in 7th grade after a year of suicidal thoughts and ultimately an attempt. I had several more attempts in my grade school years and spent plenty of time in different inpatient facilities. My parents never wanted kids so they asked me to leave as soon as I got my first after school job. So I’ve been out on my for several years (since before finishing high school). I’ve been trying to attend college part time but struggling due to depression and finances. Anyway I have to save money in order to be able to see any kind of doctor. When I did finally get to see a mental health professional, they removed my diagnosis and told me that depression is just my personality. I had been hoping to be prescribed something or offered any kind of treatment. At this point I cry more hours of the day than I sleep, every day for weeks. I don’t even know how to get myself to stop crying when I am in class, so I don’t stop. I am beginning to run out of money again and have just taken on another job for 15 hours a week on the weekends, but I am worried about losing it due to crying all day every day. I don’t know how to stop. I am also worried about paying someone to care for my dog while I am at the job, and forfeiting half the earnings. I think most of my depression is simply due to circumstances. I have never had a happy or easy life, nor felt loved or valued by another person. The therapist I had as a child convinced me to get an emotional support dog who I can now barely financially support. And since her I have never been able to afford therapy again. My depression is so debilitating I don’t want to work. I think about self harm and suicide all day and if it weren’t for my dog I would have already leapt from the roof. Unfortunately I can’t qualify for disability until I have received treatment for two consecutive years, but I can’t afford to get treatment until I complete my degree and make above minimum wage. Idk, I just wish there was some sort of system in place to help people like me. Sorry again that this was all over the place. Side note, if anyone in Seattle wants a dog and can prove that they’ll care for her as well as I do, lmk because I would love to exit.

10lue7s,1674746896,Yet Another Period of Depression This Week...,True,"Hi Reddit! I'm going through the second depressive episode this week. Many things are troubling me like how I only have 3 online friends and no irl friends. My friends have things more figured out, are living better lives, are more stable, have more friends, aren't as toxic, aren't as ugly, have a better relationship with their family, and made fewer mistakes in life than me. While they continue to do well in their lives, I continue to fail more and more—the never-ending cycle of locking myself up in my room all day except when attending college classes. My friends are likely beginning to get tired of me constantly venting about my depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm bound to end up with nothing.

I'm so angry that my life is going nowhere. Why is this world so unfair to me? Why not just end it all, right? What's left even left for me? I'm just a fucking parasite who leeches off of people and makes them pity me. I can't form and hold genuine relationships/friendships when I expect people to pity me 24/7. Such a fuck up; the black sheep in my social group who self-sabotages and sets mental blocks against those who want to help me. I feel unworthy and inadequate. I think I'm too introverted and have barely enough friends to be accepted by others. Plus, I'm convinced that I'll lose them eventually anyways. There are better people out there.

My financial situation is shit. That's another reason why my friends must hate me. I'm not worth anything and have no value in this materialistic society. I refuse to get a job despite being broke and hating it because I am struggling with this internal war. I'm behind for my age. Just whine and bitch all day and leech off of hardworking people rather than practice self-improvement. A worthless waste of space.

I'm so close to jumping off a bridge and ridding myself of this menace. I officially give up! But I really want some advice, compassion, and understanding of my predicament. I feel so alone and alienated in this world, seeing my friends and family succeed and improve themselves while I vegetate. Nothing to anyone and a forgotten memory.

Yes, I'm introverted and would be nervous having to start conversations. But I don't actually, legitimately dislike people. Not at all. It's just that I'm comfortable doing my own thing, even if that means being alone.

But, as previously stated, I'm afraid that once said girl finds out I have no friends, she will turn away and think me odd, antisocial, etc. And then I will be in despair and even further depression than I'm currently in.

10lqeaw,1674735104,"I’m just really, deeply sad",True,"I’m 19F and I just feel so incredibly sad. I was diagnosed with depression at 16 and I know now that it comes and goes. 

You know how the sea pulls back from the shore before a tsunami? That’s how it feels now. I was pretty happy for a while, or as happy as my baseline usually is, but now the wave has hit full force and I am just desperately sad. There aren’t really any other words for it. I’m fine for a little while and then I become immobilised with it. 

Some contributing factors: I’m housesitting at the moment so I’m alone in the house with two dogs. Being alone is definitely not helping but there’s not much I can do about it until the owners get back. I’ve just quit one of my jobs— to be honest I really don’t know why. The boy I’m in love with isn’t in love with me back (I know this makes me sound about fourteen, but there you go). I’m sort of in between doing things because uni hasn’t started yet. 

I’ve been walking the dogs and going to the gym every day, but none of it seems to be helping even though it should and has done in the past. I’m not on any medication— I’ve tried it but it’s really not for me (side effects). And I’m currently not seeing a therapist. I know people will suggest seeing one again, but waiting lists where I live are absurdly long and to be honest they’re simply too expensive. I’ve got pretty good insight and coping strategies that usually work for me. Also, realistically, by the time I get a session with someone I’ll be feeling better again and I won’t really need them. 

This is the thing: I know that at some point the wave will recede again and I will get my head above water. But right now, it’s really hard and I’m lonely. My parents are split and they both have work on their minds; I love them dearly but to be honest they’re not much help with this anyway. My best friend (who would usually be my first port of call) is chronically ill and has just come out of remission; I can’t bring myself to explain just how badly I’m hurting at the moment when she is dealing with her own (significant and awful) pain, and I feel it wouldn’t be fair on her to do so. So I’m sort of going it alone here.

10ll7my,1674713547,"Hello. I'm new to this, and feel like I have no where else to turn😔",True,"I don't really know how to start this off.. I'm 23, I was in therapy from 6th grade to about 6 months ago now. I'm not doing well now I'm out of therapy. 

I sit everyday in silence for the most part, and my thoughts just kinda pick me apart at their mercy. I try to cry when I feel like I need to, but I never can. I just sit there and shake cause my brain won't let my emotions come out.

When they do come out, things only ever get worse. I never say the ""right thing"". People get hurt, because I'm not good with words. I've been afraid to use my voice my whole life, because I was raised to think differently, or feel differently when something didn't sit right with me.

And now it's taking its toll on my relationship. I haven't been able to perform to her satisfaction, or hell even my satisfaction. And because of this, I forced to turn to an option that is now what seems to be crumbling my entire fucking world around me. 

I made the decision to open marriage, because I couldn't satisfy her and at first it was fun for the both of us. At first, we were both involved with the partner. Made trips, spent several afternoons with them. Of course all of this was with the general understanding of the ground rules my spouse and I discussed.

Well, as time went on, my anxiety just kept eating at me. As I watched her spend her time in her day texting these fwb's, while I sit in silence, trying to think of something I can say to her that will drift her attention to me. But I always come up empty handed, just get caught staring at her. And that makes her uncomfortable. In turn she gets aggravated, because I can never find anything to say. 

Time continued to pass.. my emotions continued to lay dormant. And as time went on... she just stopped including me in her plans. She wouldn't tell the fwb's that it's supposed to be a 3 way kinda thing, so it was just the 2 of them. And that's how it stayed. No matter how many times I told her I didn't like how much she was talking to them, or how many times I told her I wasn't comfortable. She continued to talk to them, because she didn't want to go back to ""being alone and having no one to talk to"".

That sure made me feel great about myself. But, I want to keep her happy, I want to keep her from leaving me. Cause then I really will be alone. Well, time keeps passing, and I just kept fading out of her picture with these fwb's. She came to me one night and asked me if she could travel to go meet with this man she had been talking to for a while. I was uneasy, and uncomfortable, but regardless I let her go to keep her happy. And I regret it with everything in me. 

I was at work the night she went to see him. I wasn't able to please her before she left, so as you can imagine, what happened? They met for dinner, had a great time and then fucked in the car. I expected her to tell me she gave him a blow job, and that would've been painful enough as it is. But no, she blew my expectation out of the water. 

I haven't been ok since.. I've been even more silent than normal, how thats even possible idk. Well, their relationship continued and I just have to let it happen cause I'm not enough for her. He came here to visit the next time, stayed in my house. Slept in my spare room, fucked my wife for the second time and still didn't have to decency or respect to fucking shake my hand and meet me before he high tailed it out of here at 9 am the next morning. 

Well, about 2 weeks ago. He seemed to have lost interest in my wife or something, and he ""decided he was done"" with her. So, she texted me one night while I was at work and said she was going to the bar cause she was sad. Whatever, that's fine. She's a grown woman, she can go to a bar if she wants to. I happened to get off work early and mademy way over to the bar. She was plastered drunk. Out of the 5 years I've been with her, I've never seen her like this. And all she could talk about was how much she missed him.

Made sure to tell me 4 times within the hour that she missed him so much. That it's been 70 days and she really liked him, and how she's never fucked anyone on the first date before. On the way home she cried, and talked about how she had feelings for him. I get her home and get her showered and in bed. 

And the next 4 days or so, she was not ok. She was not herself. She was distant. She was hurt. And this hurt came from another man, so as you can imagine I want to gut him now. Turns out, he broke things off with her and it's because of ME. 

He said we weren't gonna last, and he didn't want to be the reason for that. Well little does he know, the damage has already been done. You already took her out and fucked her twice without meeting me. So you leaving now is gonna do absolutely nothing for me. It's not gonna save my relationship anymore than you've already hurt it. 

I hope he feels good about himself thinking he doesn't have anything to do with my failing relationship. I hope she feels good about herself making me feel like this. I fucking hate my life, and I have for a long time. 

I don't have it in me to keep going... Feel free to give me your thoughts.. guidance, help.. anything to show me some sign of hope.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10ll7my/hello_im_new_to_this_and_feel_like_i_have_no/,TheMisfitSoul,

10lkjs5,1674711142,Nighttime Depression &amp; Anxiety | The attempt to fall asleep,True,"Firstly, this is one of my first Reddit posts. I started reading within your community and almost came to tears at how much I relate with you folks. I’m here to speak up on behalf of myself.

I do understand this has been a common thread, but I haven’t been able to find concrete solutions or even ways to make sense of it.

This all started when I was at boarding school, around my junior year. Prior to this time, I had never had trouble falling asleep in response to negative thoughts. Thoughts about what I’d become, about how it would be too late for me to catch up, about the worst possible case-scenario. I worry about my mom getting old, I worry about my girlfriend leaving me, about losing my job, etc.

(Quick note: I have never experienced what many call ‘failure’ in my entire life. Went to my top choice University, work in big tech. Only mentioning to highlight the boarding school junior year piece, I was never regretful of concrete things witnessed by others. I have credit card debt and all, but life is long and I can’t quite figure out what it is. Purely for context)

I’m laying in bed next to my girlfriend in our apartment right now and I want to cry! I know tomorrow is a new day, and I am NOT nor have I ever thought I might be better off not on this planet. But every night it just burns. She’s asleep and assumes I am. I purposefully don’t drink at this time because it’s too easy. 

Are there any ways you all cope with this? How do normal people fall asleep haha (I made myself giggle amid this comment).

I think they'll just tell me to keep going and don't give up and there's a lot of prospect and opportunities in this field (like most asian parents).

I think the most logical solution for me currently is to just either take a gap year or just switch major (both of which will not make my parents happy). But I doubting those solutions. Maybe I should just suck it up and keep going. Maybe I should just try to work harder. I'm not sure anymore.

10lge8b,1674698172,I’m not sure if I’m depressed,True,"Like I said I’m not sure if I’m depressed, my mom says I am. I’m a 14 year old boy (5’4 120lbs) and my “depression” started about 4 months ago.

     It all started when we moved in to my moms boyfriends house. He has two kids one boy and one girl. For the sake of the story we will call the boyfriend Jake (not his real name). Jake is a nice guy besides the fact that he is pretty strict and swears a lot he cares about his kids and my mom and sister a lot. He taught me how to hunt and before he taught me how to hunt I only had one issue with him. I was eating in my room even after my mom told be not to. So it was completely my fault and I know that, but the way he treated me was really bad he told me to get off my bed and as I was walking up stairs be was yelling in my ear and he was spitting while talking. Fast forward after that  my mother and I argued a lot over grades and me not associating with anyone in the “family”. Jake jumped into these arguments a lot so I argued with him to. Eventually I got grounded from my games (one of the very few ways I could hang out with my friends since I moved). Once I go home I go straight to my room and lay on my bed while reading on my phone. I don’t eat with them because I have to ask to have the food that they cook and that gets annoying when you get told no all the time. I stay up till around 12-2 almost every night. I’m a growing boy so of course I still eat at night once everyone is asleep I grab snacks and whatnot.

     The only reason why I don’t know if I’m actually depressed or not is because I rarely cry, and I have fun at school with my friends. My only school problems are that my grades are starting to slip. Also I recently tore the cartilage in between my ribs so I can’t wrestle and I also can’t wrestle because of my grades. Besides this though I think I’m fine?

Last year I had overcame this feeling of wanting to make friends and talk to girls at college. With no success in this, I fell into a deep depression. Over the Summer I learned to manage it and I actually became unfazed by not having much of a social life, even though I used to crave it. I learned to be happy while being lonely and I actually broke some negative habits that were holding me back. I stopped smoking weed and deleted social media. Now with the new semester underway, I saw a girl in my class that I find attractive but I haven’t had the courage of talking to her. That’s completely on me. I had the opportunity to talk to this girl last week. She was completely alone in the hallway. It was my chance. I just couldn’t bring myself to initiate a conversation. That’s completely on me.  Today was her birthday and she was talking with some other classmates about a party she’s having tonight. The only thought I had all day today was “what if I had talked to her last week and she had invited me to this party?”Damn. I don’t want to feel this way because I know it will snowball and make me fall into depression once again. I need to be unbothered by other people’s social life and be content with what I have. I also should seize the moment when given the chance. The only thing I can do is give myself positive thoughts and trust that everything will turn out ok.

There never has been ya know? I can't continue going on like everything is alright though so here I am typing my thoughts for all the most random people to look at. 

As the title says I don't know what side I'm fighting for. I'm sure it's better on the other side and I'm sure it's brighter and filled with love and joy beyond anything I've experienced. But getting there? Dragging myself through the mud time and time and time again only to be kicked back down and left alone and forgotten? I convinced myself that I'm better off alone. That life without connections is the only way to live. I convinced myself that I'd rather see my friends happy and joyful than myself experience it. 

There's a really really hard thing that I'm trying to do. Essentially it's a personal moral inventory of myself...my life. I don't want to face that, my sins and failures. Every bad day I have to write down. Every bad moment I have to put to paper and isn't it so funny that what will do me in won't be the actual experiences, but facing and accepting them? Now I get it when they say the fall will kill you. 

The only and I truly do mean only thing that keeps me going every day is the thought that I want to one day be a husband and father. Break the cycles that my family has had for generations so that my descendants can live better lives. 

I have a great job and I really do have people in my life that I know would be there for me if I really needed it. I also know that I'd never ask for it from them. The world tells me that I have to be ok and I am this close to a breakdown. For no reason at all like three times I started crying at work. I'm supposed to be better than that. Supposed to just hold it in and not let the world get to me. 

I don't know how to combat this, especially when I can't even decipher it in myself to know if I want to fix what's wrong with me or just continue living in this hell because there is so much shame and blame and guilt and fear and sorrow in my past.

There's still a lot of things I haven't accomplished yet. I'm nowhere near the person I used to be. But I can take the small wins when I can 

Alright, now I'm rambling from this point on 😆

Just recently I lost hearing in my left ear. This has happened before so I'm used to it. It's the ear wax building up because I've neglected to clean my ears properly. For a while I thought I was just lazy but... I think it's tied to whatever the fuck is happening in my head. When it gets this bad I can't clear it myself and have to go to an actual clinic to get it cleaned. I just don't wanna spend the money... Sigh. Now that I think about it, I don't do everything I should do for personal hygiene. I literally only shower once a week. If I use lotion it's only for my face, so I'm at least presentable in public. I do the bare minimum to be socially acceptable to people. I trim my fingernails proper because people can see those, but my toenails are gross LOL 

Guess I shouldn't put more of my gross-ass hygiene on the Internet so I'll stop there 

But I think these posts are good for me. When I go see the psychiatrist they can serve as reminders of what my state of mind was like, and I can tell them what's going on. I saw that post from the depression memes subreddit where they joked about not knowing what they want to talk about to their therapist. I'm still contemplating if I should actually show them the original posts... Because I'm sure the content would be alarming enough to send me straight to the psych ward.

I'm 22 with 0 friends, a family that's falling apart, and am treated like an outsider wherever i go, because of how uncomfortable i am with people.

I dread. I curl up in a ball of fear at tbe idea that i'll have to burry my loved ones.

10ldshi,1674690919,Went through a depressive episode and I’m worried it scared my boyfriend off - how can I come back from this?,True,"
Been with my (27F) boyfriend (30M) for a year and a half. We recently moved in together and also went through a few big life changes that have really unsettled me. 

I’m normally a very happy and fun girl but over the last month or so I fell into what I now realise was a depressive episode (likely triggered by feeling really unsettled.) 

Everything has been making me cry, I’ve been feeling really hopeless, and I’ve found it impossible to feel loved. 

We’re spending a lot of time together at the moment and he’s unfortunately seen me cry most days and heard me be miserable and talk about how I don’t feel great about the future right now. 

I’m in therapy and have also been working on trying to pull myself out of this, and I’m feeling gradually better, but as I come out of it I can sense my boyfriend is quite distant now and doesn’t seem as into me anymore. 

Throughout this whole ordeal I’ve said to him many times that I’m really sorry he has to see me like this, and expressed my guilt/embarrassment about it, to which he’s been nothing but kind - he says he loves me in all my forms, and I’ll come out of this and we’ll have a great year. 

He hasn’t actually said anything to make me think he’s not into me anymore, but I just feel like something’s off. He’s always on his phone, we barely have sex anymore (unless I initiate), and he’s less affectionate now. I just don’t feel as wanted/loved anymore and that’s making me really sad. I feel like I ruined this amazing thing I had with him by being relentlessly miserable for a month. 

When I’ve tried to talk to him about it he just says he loves me, but I’m trying to avoid bringing it up too much because I don’t want to be constantly asking for reassurance, plus I’m still sensitive so I don’t want to risk crying and making things even worse. 

I feel like before this episode, he found me cool and fun and “high value” (for lack of a better term) but now he’s seen me in this pathetic state and he’s suddenly turned off/realises he could do better. 

My question is, have I ruined this forever? Is there any coming back from this, and if so, what do I need to do? 

I miss my sweet loving boyfriend who thought I was cool and not pathetic. 

Tldr: I had a depressive episode and now I think my boyfriend is questioning his desire for me. Is there any way to get back the connection we had before he saw me is this light?",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10ldshi/went_through_a_depressive_episode_and_im_worried/,Bleepbloop3002,

I am 23F and I have my own apartment. I hardly spend time in my apartment because I feel guilty leaving my parents and my older sister who is disabled. I literally live 2 minutes away but still feel extreme guilt. I am getting used to being in my apartment more and I like it but now it's like I limit myself to go out. I can't go out anywhere because I feel that I have to spend time with my parents. 

My parents always treated me as a child and making this big step is hard. I also got married 2 years ago and it didn't work out. It was long distance relationship of 5 years and I kind of felt unsure of getting married but still did it because I wanted to please others. He cheated on me and we are separated now. My parents don't know we are separated. I met this other guy, but it didn't work out either. Now I am heart broken, absolutely depressed and can't stop the guilt. Each day at night, I think about my failing relationships, I think about how I wish I could focus on myself but don't know how. I think about how going out makes me feel guilty because that means I don't get to spend time with my parents. I feel this sense of emptiness and extreme depression. I talked to my therapist about this today and it didn't go well. She was very harsh on me and basically said that my life is like swimming against the tide because I can't stop thinking about negative things and feel depressed.   


I really wish I knew how to stop thinking about my problems but I just don't know how. How can I stop feeling heart broken about my failing relationships? How can I stop missing someone who is not for me? How can I work on myself and be happy? How can I spend time in my apartment without feeling guilty? I am also having a very hard time saving money because I pay my bills and also help out my parents with some bills here and there. I have good things in life, my pets, family, friends, job, roof, food but I can't help but feel sad and empty. No one understands me. Everyone tells me to just to move on and stop thinking about things but I just can't. Is there something wrong with me? Do i have some sort of disorder that doesn't allow me to stop or control my negative thinking. I just don't understand what I am doing wrong.

I played a lot of football and my dream was to become even a proffesional footballer some day. I played in a small club in a local city. I'm not really sporty, I mean I do have a will of the warrior, but I don't have any abilities like strenght, acceleration or pace. I am just really weak physicaly.  Everybody told me that I won't make it, and after 5 years of fighting and lying to myself, that all Dreams can become true only if you have enough Faith, i gave up. I am really Creative and I love creating a lot of things like drawings, videos, music etc. My parents bought me a computer 2 years ago. But after a year, they had a problem with it. They thought that I use it too much for playing games. But playing games was a part of my creation. I created a lot of videos on youtube based on gameplays.

It's been a while since I've been unable to actually cry and when I do it's only one tear from one eye and that's it.
Now, luckily nothing happened in my life to actually makes me cry but I noticed that after a while of being unable to cry I started to get incredibly frustrated because I can't cry.
When I watch some sad show I can't cry and it's annoying, I want to cry but I can't.

I also noticed that even my emotions are almost non-existent, I feel happiness or other stuff but it's really really ""low"" or it's literally nothing at all.
When I'm supposed to be happy I don't actually feel happy, I act as if I'm happy.
For example a friend of mine gave me a really sweet letter for my birthday saying they were glad they met me and I too am glad to be friends with them however when I read that letter I felt nothing.

I looked like a business man trying to act nice but internally to me that was nothing.
I acted like I was happy and almost about to cry because of happiness but I said that just because, however I didn't felt nothing.
I know I feel a bit of emotions however because I feel guilty or other stuff but I still don't feel anything most of the time and I can't understand why.
I get sad and almost about to cry but never actually do it and if I do it's just a tear but I still don't really feel sad.

Which i understand he just wants me to be responsible and I’ve had many great jobs in healthcare in the past. I am fully capable of getting another good paying job. I just hate how he emotionally is not there for me. I’ve even brought it up to him and he tells me aim just “being dramatic”. Or that i’m “being crazy”. It really hurts because so just want him to understand. My mom is a lot nicer than my dad if we’re being real but even she always sides with him.

10lb34b,1674684100,I can’t do anything for myself anymore.,True,"F 19 here. I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore. I used to be like a straight a student and wanted to go to a four year university and be a teacher and then work my way up to professor. I had a ten year plan lol. And then suddenly i started to lose interest in school. Nothing happened. I just kept trying and trying and my grades kept dropping and dropping. I think at a certain point I stopped caring and just stopped trying. Then I started having death after death after death in the family starting with my grandma, then my other grandma, and then my dad. People say that’s why I am the way I am now but I think it’s just a piss poor excuse. I almost didn’t graduate high school my senior year. I wanted about half of a year and then started at my local community college. I was doing great. And then I stopped. I’ve tried to get job after job and I keep quitting. I can’t hold a job for the life of me. My boyfriend supports me and we live at my moms house which is basically a trap house. I lay in bed all day and I’m lucky if I shower, or brush my teeth , or comb my hair. I hardly ever clean my room so it’s disgusting. And I’m making no genuine efforts towards my future. And I don’t even know what I want for my future anymore. if I’ll be able to keep a job after college. If I’ll be able to do any of it.

Reflecting on my life, Ive never had a girlfriend or never experienced a girl being interested me.

10lamuz,1674683003,Isn’t it odd?,True,"When I think back to my youth it was dreadful. Everyday was full of feeling self conscious, depressed before I knew what depression or any of my other mental illnesses were. Bullied everyday in school just to come home to abuse. 
Wishing everyday I was older, wiser and able to pull myself out of all of that. 

But that feeling of being young was unreal. I knew none of it really mattered because I had a future. I could go over to a friends house and feel “cool” for a weekend. I could relieve myself from the stress because it wasn’t all bad, I still had things coming ahead. Life wasn’t in my control which felt awful at the time, but in retrospect the only thing that kept me sane. 

I’m by no means old now, but holy shit. I have this feeling like I’ve done everything I can do. I don’t care about anything now and there is no “future”. Treatment is being exhausted all while giving me even less hope (Partially why I feared it for all those years to begin with). I’ve accomplished all of the goals I had for myself years ago. And it’s all gone. My loving relationship, my hobbies, my jobs. All in the past, with absolutely no reason to start again. 

I guess I’m stuck in the past. However I’ve never had any long term goals or reason to push forward. Life seems to have always been planned out for me. Feels like it’s over, like I’m finished almost. I can’t even explain the feeling. All I know is that with youth there was pain but also a feeling of excitement. It’s so fucking weird to just feel done.

10l9iqw,1674680320,I need some advice,True,"So I’m a 21 year old Male and I’m still a virgin. I’ve never had a girlfriend and I’ve never had sex. I’ve never had the chance to have a girlfriend and have sex in my entire life. I live in a small town in the UK where’s there’s not much to do, it’s pretty isolated. There’s a few pubs and some shops, but the social groups are full of old people. 

I work in retail. I work part time in a supermarket 3 days a week. The only time I regularly leave the house is to go to work and to take my puppy for a walk. I acknowledge that I should go out more and that’s something I want to do anyway. When I’m not working I get bored being stuck in the house.

I have a place for University this year but that’s in September. If I do I will be living there away from my parents and family. This means I will be living in a city with many more things to do. I will be living on campus. I’m planning on joining societies and clubs that interest me. Where I will live is a 15 minute bus journey away from the town centre. There will be nightclubs, bars, events, restaurants, shops, etc. Just more things to do in general. There’s also a beach nearby. 

I’m on a few dating apps and I’ve also downloaded some meet up apps. If I go to Uni I’m planning on using these apps whilst I’m there which means I could meet some girls or something. Right now it seems like Uni is one of my only ways to get out of my current isolated town and do more in my life. If I go it will basically be a fresh start.

I’ve lived in rural isolated areas most of my life so this will be a completely different experience. If I don’t go to Uni I will have to get full time retail work and it will take much longer to move out to a better and bigger area.

I would say I’m average in terms of looks. I’m not necessarily ugly but I’m not too attractive either. In terms of confidence my current job has helped me to become socially confident when talking to coworkers and customers.

10l8il4,1674677846,"Angry, Sad, Anxious and Hopeless - Apparently Treatment Resistant",True,"I am at that point destructive behavior due to meds. About 10 years ago I took loratabs (self medicated). I took them religiously as if they were prescribed 2-3 per day for pain, anxiety and depression. Needless to say, that became expensive and difficult to obtain. Although I only increased dose slightly over 3 years, it was just hard to get and pushed me to see a dr.

Unknowingly what that would have in store for me, I chose to see a Psychiatrist. I had well over 200 loratabs stock piled that day I first saw him. Walked in thinking it was going to be a pointless visit. I walked out with a script for adderall and never touched another loratab. I barely had a clue what adderall was or what the next few years would have in store for me. 

Fast forward about 3 more years and I found myself still taking the same dose of adderall but the Xanax was up to 4-5 mg daily. 

I no longer could keep a steady job. Tried self employment and failed miserably, found self completely bankrupt and ended up hospitalized for a week due to my stubbornness and quitting all meds including SSRI’s cold turkey. They simply made me a screw up that felt like crap all of the time.

Upon release the hospital Dr. Injected me with a 30 day shot of Abilify along with some other meds and sent me on way. That was pure freaking misery. 30 days of Benadryl every 4 hours and pure hell. It wasn’t long before I was back at my original Psyc and back on a new cocktail that consisted of adderall Xanax remeron and Zoloft then turned to prestiq.

So here I sit, another 4 years or so later, miserable as fuck, mad at the world, angrier than I have ever felt, full of anxiety and hopeless as it gets. 

I guess it’s better than the complete zombie I was before running out of prestiq and deciding the time had come for change again. That was on Dec. 30th. 

Now with a new psyc and GP I am still being pushed new meds to try.  

Lexapro - stopped after 3 days. Refuse to take something that has the side effects of SSRI/SNRI’s anymore. 

Pregablin - said take 25-75 at night for sleep. Well it only helps during the day at atleast 75mg 2 times a day and not sure what it’s hurting all I know is it’s helping with the neck and shoulder pain that’s literally become unbearable!

Is there any hope to have left. I’ve told dr after dr that the only thing that has ever worked on me was loratabs. But I guess our government rules restrict their ability or desire to prescribe that so they pump me up full of everything else in gods creation and tell me I was self medicating and those pills won’t help. 

Someone tell me if I am the one whose unable to think logically here. I can certainly see what people turn to heroin! Fortunately I worry so damn much I can’t bring myself to try it. 

If opiates are the only thing that helps my mental and physical disabilities, how can I convince a dr to help or is there any other medication options that do the same for someone who is unable to obtain any long term treatment success with SSRI’s, stimulants and benzo’s?",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10l8il4/angry_sad_anxious_and_hopeless_apparently/,PaulnJenny,

10l80uu,1674676683,My life is a mess,True,"Not looking for help or empty platitudes.  Just venting.  Putting this into writing to see how I feel it looks.  Maybe I'll look back on this in a decade and will see how far I've come.  We'll see.

I've been suffering from crippling anxiety and depression for more than half my life.  When I was 21 I got into some legal trouble that is just humiliating.  No jail but I did catch a charge.  It was my own dumb ass fault but over the years I've remembered things from my own f'd childhood that would cause these mental issues.  Still my fault.  This is the first thing I think about every morning and the thing that keeps me awake every single night.  I haven't been able to talk to anybody about it except for the shrinks I spent years with who did absolutely nothing for me.  I can't even talk to myself honestly about it.  It's been balling up inside of me for about 26 years now.  I thought that it would get easier with time but it hasn't.  It's gotten worse.  At the time, I badly wanted to kill myself but some weird obligation to my broken family stopped me.  But my mom died a few months ago so I feel less burdened.

In a last-ditch effort to make my life worth it and to try to become happy, I got married and had a kid.  This really complicates things.  My son is my life and he is so much better a person than I could ever imagine being.  I do wish though that I'd never had him.  I wouldn't know any different.  Now of course my concern is what will he go through if I leave?  Maybe less if it's an 'accident'?  As much as I love my son, bringing him into the world didn't make me any more happy.  I put on a fake smile every time I see him but I feel like it's just a mask and that everyone sees through it.

10l7nw4,1674675837,"I can't stop thinking ""it's useless to be alive"" despite I'm not depressed anymore. Is that just a normal feeling for an adult ?",True,"[TW : suicide]

Hi people, 

I'm a 25 yo man and two years ago, I tried to kill myself with pills but I just end up with some definitive injuries to my brain. Shortly after that, I decided to stop my medication suddenly despite the weaning and been forced to go to therapy. It helps me a lot and now I really feel better. 

When I say ""better"" that's mean I don't have uncontrollable suicidal pulsion anymore, I can wake up in the morning and go to work, I can talk to people, I don't cry every day, I don't have panic attack or unbearable sadness... So I consider myself as ""not depressed anymore"". 

Despite those facts, I continue to feel empty, embittered and useless. I live alone, I work from 9 A.M to 7 P.M, and when I go home I have 2-3 hours of free time but I have some difficulty to enjoy it. I don't enjoy my work neither despite it was my childhood dream job (developer). I don't know why I'm alive.. I got a girlfriend who lived in another city and we see each other 2-4 days a month. I don't visit my family more than a week per year because I feel anxious around them. But I see my friends every Saturday to play music together. 

So my life isn't that bad.. I feel like I have to enjoy it and be happy to be alive and survived my suicide attempt.. but it's not the case. I can't stop saying to myself ""it will change nothing if I die, I don't have to force myself to be alive"". Is that normal for an adult to have nothing in his life and feel this way ? Maybe its caused by passing from teenagehood to adulthood ?",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10l7nw4/i_cant_stop_thinking_its_useless_to_be_alive/,Diabolischste,

I am 24, male, 190cm, average looking (not so handsome but also not ugly),  hard worker in a decent company,  intelligent, train everyday to stay strong and fit, eating healthy, being responsible. Emigrated from my country looking for a better future with just 18.... Even after all that, I feel like my life is not worth anything.  I am not financially succesfull that I could be proud of, I did not achieve anything amazing that I can be proud of, Women seems to like more the type of guy who goes to party every weekend and spends all his salary every month. I live a life full with honesty, values, hard work, like my grandparents always teached me, and I always wanted to make them proud, yet, I feel like this world is made for other type of people to win , while the good people will always struggle to live like they want.

I grew up in a place wich a lot of criminality , violence and other stuff that you can imagine.  When you grew up in places like that you know how easy is for some people making a living sometimes and win in life, doing things they should not. And now after I was in the military, I was thinking about joining police academy one day. But now, I just ask me if it is worth it, to be one of the good guys, to take the slow route, instead of using my knowledge (guns, tactics, malice) and experience in places like I grew up, full with dirty busieness and corruption, to use it on my favor, and level my life up. 

Because it does not matter how hard I work, how honest I am, how of a good person I try to be. I am just stuck on the same place in life

I am just looking maybe for some advice, or some reason that you can think of, about being a good human in this world. I don't believe more in ""you just have to be positive, everything will change one day""... Or ""at the end it will pay off"".. things like that.

10l6355,1674672175,"Tired of living, my life story",True,"I’m not sure where to start but I guess I’ll talk a little about myself. And honestly I’m not even sure anybody will see this or notice this post. I guess idgaf either way. Maybe I’m looking for attention, sympathy or someone to talk to idk I’m just talking, and if you believe this to be larp or anything like that just please move on, it’s prob not worth reading anyways.

I’m 28M, I’ve been depressed in the past, when I was in high school. My parents were gamblers and they’ve pretty much gambled away their life savings at the time. Which resulted in our family not being able to pay rent; eventually we ended up homeless. I think my depression was an all time high back then, but eventually one thing led to another, authorities, school counselors this and that I ended up in foster care with my sister.

Months go by, they put me in college financially and shit like that. I think that’s around maybe the 2nd year I get over my depression with focus on school and shit. 3rd year I meet my first girlfriend it was amazing. 4th year she studies abroad for a semester, in that time we breakup because well I was too needy, long distance, she was busy meeting new people and stuff like that. Before we officially broke up I’m pretty sure she cheated on me with another guy abroad because she’s told me closer to present day they had sex but never told me when it was. Anyways around the time we broke up someone at our school was hit by the local freight train, I don’t remember the exact details but I vividly remember that as a time I felt extremely suicidal, I didn’t know the person but I just felt some type of way about it, I don’t know if this is normal.

Last semester of college my ex girlfriend came back from abroad and we got back together, yea I know dumb move but what else is new. At the end of college I was pretty much determined to make this relationship work, even after getting a job in another state I would drive 8 hours just to pick her up from the airport where she lived and spend 1 day together. Big mistake as that was when she decided it’s really time to break up as the future wouldn’t work. Wasted effort after wasted effort.

Fast forward, new job, new friends and stuff. I focus on myself for these years telling myself I no longer wanna be in a position where I feel this emotionally dependent. I think this is around 2017, I get pretty rich off crypto (nothing crazy just like 100k) and I’m happy af at 23 or however old I am at the time. I spend a lot of money traveling to different countries with my sister and have a lot of fun.

2018 I meet my current gf, she’s fun caring loving gorgeous, perfect. First year was obviously amazing as the honeymoon phase is so real. 2nd year my friend introduced me to a side hustle that I got really into and she supported my efforts in that. But over the course of the next 1-2 years I put more effort into making money than my relationship. I started my own online business and it really popped off but I was stressed and got pissed off at her for trivial things said things I don’t mean etc if I could rewind I would 

Present day we still are together we live together, but she makes it a priority to talk to other people now, sometimes I feel as if our relationship has no real purpose. Top of the morning or even as we’re about to sleep she’s texting other friends. She hasn’t told me she loved me in over a year, we haven’t had sex or been intimate really either due to a combination of lack of trust and there was an incident on one of our friend group trips where I got so wasted I was told I basically cheated on her (not sex or kissing but it doesn’t matter) 

Anyways pouring my life story here. TLDR depressed guy, successful in the money sense, current relationship is in the dumps, feel like I fuck everything up that I do, tired of life, nobody to talk to (mainly cuz I don’t wanna bother friends with my sorry problems) 

Looking to end it, just in the least messy way possible.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, which isn't a very long time because I seem to have repressed my entire childhood.

In fact, I can't really seem to be worried about much anymore, just whatever doesn't involve me. If it's someone else suffering, I want to help, but I can't push myself to help myself. 

I went to therapy a few years ago and she thought I might actually be on the spectrum to a degree. I do check some boxes to be fair to her, I wouldn't be surprised if I am slightly autistic. I also have a sneaky suspicion that my depression might be passively fueled by undiagnosed ADHD or one of its variants. So many things about me from when I was younger line up with these possible disorders and maybe even others too. 

I'm not here to give a deep dive into my head, I'm not ready for that to be attached to my profile forever, but I do wonder if it's worth trying to get to the bottom of all this. I suffered some serious abuse as a child that I denied myself accepting as abuse and couldn't process for a very long time because of that attitude to it, so that definitely plays a factor in who I am now. At my age, in my position in life as a (failing) University student, is it worth even trying to diagnose anything concrete like a disorder? I don't even know where to begin that journey if I do decide to follow it. 

Anyone else here who got a diagnosis later in life, or went through the testing process later in life, did any of it make a difference? Is it something I should look into?

10l3evs,1674665830,Scared of my future that I myself am actively ruining,True,"I have been feeling extremely lonely a long time. Never in my life have I had a heart to heart conversation with 'anyone' even though I have been a part of a friend group since my childhood. I just turned 23 and have not hanged out with them since 2019. Before I quit hanging out with them I used to feel extremely exhausted after every time I did. For quite some time I remeber telling myself that this would be last but next time we had plans on some holiday I would go anyway thinking I would be bored at home. I used to remain silent most of the time I felt like I never could be myself while with them. Also sometimes I used to be made fun of about multiple things, and despite they were harmless it really felt bad as those often used to be their only interaction with me the entire time. So I stopped going. I also was doing really bad at academics. I admitted to college but could not focus on my studies at all and left within a year. After I left within 6 months covid arrived and did not really leave home or do anything until recently. Last year I admitted to college again but still can't really focus on my studies. I am really worried about my future. I don't know why I am so depressed all the time. The reason I mentioned ceasing to go out with my friends is because I kind of regeret it and feel really anxious that I will never have another friend in my life with whom I can talk my heart out even though I never had, but maybe if I kept in touch with them and worked on myself I could have made such a friend. Now they all have graduated and working. I can't make any new friends, I never even feel like it and still feel extremely lonely sometimes and it's more dreadful now as it feels like this is going to be life from now on. Since this is still  affecting my studies I don't know how am I going to finish college and what if even if I do by the time I get a job I will be too old to have a partner and have to live my entire life alone? I am really scared. I daydream living the best life I can imagine a lot but don't do anything to achieve it. Am I just lazy?

10l39m2,1674665465,Why am I so miserable?,True,"First off I want to start by saying I don’t think I am depressed or suffer from depression. There are certainly people who are far more miserable than I and have more to be miserable over. 

I am a perfectly healthy 24 year old living in a major city in the United States. I am a recent college graduate who was recently admitted into law school. I have a very good future ahead of me. I’m currently dating the woman who I hopefully will marry she herself is soon graduating with a degree that allows her to start work immediately making a insanely competitive salary to what I hope to be making after law school. I have a lot of friends I usually have a consistently healthy bank account considering my situation and I work a job that is directly related to the legal profession I am aiming for. I’ve never been bullied or made to feel like I’m less than the average Joe I aspire to be. I try my hardest to be nice to everyone and take pride in being as polite as possible.

I have always been the comedic confidence guy who can be counted on to cheer everybody up but I have always been a miserable sap on the inside and had always banked on that changing by this point in my life. I am so close to having everything I have ever wanted and even still this sense of loneliness and self hatred dominates my thoughts every second I’m not engaged in conversation with someone. My girlfriend wanted to celebrate me getting into law school and even still I just simply don’t feel like I even deserve to celebrate. 

Idk what I hoped to accomplish with this post but I just felt really good being honest with myself in a somewhat open way. Thanks for reading.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10l39m2/why_am_i_so_miserable/,skateboardsNTits,
10l3179,1674664888,Is studying Games Design at University worth it?,True,"So I have a place to study Games Design at University for September 2023. I’m currently deciding whether it’s worth going or not. My current life situation isn’t as good as I want it to be. I currently work in a part time retail job in a supermarket in my town which is only 15.5 hours a week. The job is ok but as it’s retail it can get pretty stressful at times and the pay isn’t that good. It’s also not enough hours.

I currently live in a small town in the UK where’s there’s not much to do. If I go to Uni it’s in a city so I will be living there. There’s clubs, bars, a beach, events, more shops, etc. Currently my life isn’t very exciting. I only leave the house to go to work and I don’t socialise. I don’t have many friends who are willing to meet up with me.

When I was in College I studied and passed an Animation for Games &amp; Media course which basically gives me the qualifications to be able to study Games Design at University. I feel as if Games Design is the only thing I would be interested in studying, I don’t have any other career paths in mind. 

I just feel going to University will not only be more beneficial for my mental health by reducing loneliness and having the opportunities to go out and do more, but getting a degree opens up many more job opportunities compared to not going to Uni and not getting a degree and just staying in retail. If I chose not to go to Uni I would either have to quit my current retail job and try and get a full time retail job instead, or I would have to apply for a 2nd part time retail job so that I’m working enough hours so that I earn enough money to move out. 

I just can’t imagine myself working in retail for the rest of my life.

I also find it very frustrating when I try to explain why I'm so miserable and people seem to, I don't know, not believe me? Not understand how hard this is? I'm not just a little tired and need to cheer up, I'm barely able to not snap at everyone and everything some times. 

I have other disorders too (adhd, autism spectrum, personality disorder, addiction, fkn gender dysphoria) and SAD just makes it all worse.

But I just feel like I'm falling apart since the day I left a hospital. I don't know what I know anymore. Everything I do seems like trash.

I always considered myself as a healthy person, with just a few issues now it looks like my whole body revolts against me (again, nothing serious but plenty of small unpleasant issues). Damn I even got plenty of weight and my skin turned into a scale, which is kinda funny, since I always felt myself a little ashamed for being a little too pretty for my own taste.

Like I feel myself such a dumbass, with no skills or knowledge, and all my previous jobs were either fraud, or ""nobody else wanted to do it"", or just good will of people who allowed me to do crap and get money for it (mostly mix of all three).  


The most awkward part, is my great and supportive family. They won't push me to hard, since any job I can possibly find would be a very minor part of their budget. But they either sincerely believe I'm a person of multiple talents (usually in areas I have some surface knowledge and they have none) or just want to encourage me. And it's also because of them (and also of my curiosity about what's gonna happened next) I can't even kill myself, since they gonna be really upset and probably even traumatized if I do so.   


But it's just kills me, how much of a burden I am. And I feel myself ashamed and ungrateful for feeling down, while plenty of people, even ones I know have much worse struggles on their hands.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kyt1j/not_sure_if_i_have_a_real_depression_or_just/,chiffoid,

10kymvh,1674653350,Can you have a healthy relationship?,True,"Hey all. 

As someone who has had a bit of a tough life from childhood I sometimes notice that my behavior sometimes is not the healthiest (I don’t mean I’m toxic, but what I mean is that I can be brutally honest and inconsiderate of peoples feelings as I always think that everybody is just as tough as me; or I can have periods where I am sad and need time to process what is going in my head and not everybody understands that… ptsd - what can I do 🤷‍♀️). Anyway, I know I am a bit broken and it’ll never go away. 

So my question is, do you guys think that people like me can attract healthy partners? Can we stay with these partners (as I have been with people who have had amazing childhoods and no drama but I have never felt understood)? Any time things go well, I always self sabotage - can that be fixed?

I also haven’t been able to really connect or socialize with the people I love, and that includes my boyfriend. It makes me wonder if it’s depression or we shouldn’t be together. I know when we’re both good, we’re good. But I just can’t shake that crazy feeling you get in your gut when it’s time for a breakup. I told my therapist a little bit about this and she asked if there’s any part of me that wants to break up with him, and I honestly don’t know.

10kyein,1674652629,Scared about my future that I am actively ruining myself,True,"I have been feeling extremely lonely a long time. Never in my life have I had a heart to heart conversation with 'anyone' even though I have been a part of a friend group since my childhood. I just turned 23 and have not hanged out with them since 2019. Before I quit hanging out with them I used to feel extremely exhausted after every time I did. For quite some time I remeber telling myself that this would be last but next time we had plans on some holiday I would go anyway thinking I would be bored at home. I used to remain silent most of the time I felt like I never could be myself while with them. Also sometimes I used to be made fun of about multiple things, and despite they were harmless it really felt bad as those often used to be their only interaction with me the entire time. So I stopped going. I also was doing really bad at academics. I admitted to college but could not focus on my studies at all and left within a year. After I left within 6 months covid arrived and did not really leave home or do anything until recently. Last year I admitted to college again but still can't really focus on my studies. I am really worried about my future. I don't know why I am so depressed all the time. The reason I mentioned ceasing to go out with my friends is because I kind of regeret it and feel really anxious that I will never have another friend in my life with whom I can talk my heart out even though I never had, but maybe if I kept in touch with them and worked on myself I could have made such a friend. Now they all have graduated and working. I can't make any new friends, I never even feel like it and still feel extremely lonely sometimes and it's more dreadful now as it feels like this is going to be life from now on. Since this is still  affecting my studies I don't know how am I going to finish college and what if even if I do by the time I get a job I will be too old to have a partner and have to live my entire life alone?

10kv2pn,1674640220,Prescribed a new med- it's AMAZING,True,"I just have to share this. I'm a 32 year old man. I've been on and off antidepressants most of my life. None of them ever helped me and I've decided and told my doctor/ therapist that I am never taking any antidepressant ever again. I'm done with them. 

I take two different kinds of benzodiazepines as needed. I have struggled with addiction to these meds in the past but I am learning to ""moderate"" and truly take them as needed. Honestly I don't even like benzos that much overall. Sometimes they are wonderful and I do genuinely need them but other times they just make me feel sick and more depressed. (I take them for my anxiety). I would prefer to just never take them or take one or two a month. I'm working on that.

I recently was doing research and asked to be prescribed Baclofen for anxiety. I honestly didn't expect it to do anything. Within 40 minutes it was like my depression and anxiety were GONE. Not just reduced/manageable (as I feel with benzos) but literally gone. I thought- ok, this must just be a placebo effect. And I thought I shouldn't get my hopes up.

I've been taking it for a couple weeks now, as needed. For example yesterday I took Baclofen as prescribed. Before that I didn't take it for two days. I'm going to take it again today. 

Positive effects: total elimination of depression. Major reduction in anxiety. No negative effects at all (unlike benzos and especially antidepressants). 

The thing is- I didnt actually realise how profoundly depressed I was until I started this medication. I always told people I have severe anxiety but only a mild depression, sometimes moderate. Man was I wrong- I've been suffering from severe depression but I was so used to it and didn't know any different.

I'm actually laughing out loud now and smiling- not forcing laughter or faking it anymore. It's amazing. Baclofen is better than benzos- much less addictive, as far as I can tell no side effects. Why isn't this being prescribed more? 

Doctors and therapists need to get off the antidepressant wagon. I'm so sick of being told to take a medication that can take months to work, make you feel worse/ more suicidal when there are meds like Baclofen that work immediately for some people.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kv2pn/prescribed_a_new_med_its_amazing/,Decent-Author-6671,

10kv0bk,1674639936,Suicide Groundhog Day,True,"Does anyone here struggle with wanting to kill themselves at every little thing? 

The reason I ask is because this has become my brain's default response to just about anything that happens to me. Someone could say something triggering, I could just be feeling a little bit down, and my brain is wired so that I instantly want to die. 

I also experience chronic pain that feels almost supernatural, or like a curse on my body that I've had for a long time, as I have yet to reach middle age. I realize that these are the side effects of having long term major depressive disorder, but it is unbearable for me. 

Life feels like groundhog day, where I am waking up to the same feelings regardless of circumstance (I have lived in several countries, worked objectively interesting jobs have lived what others would categorize as an ""adventurous"" and ""full"" life and told that ""my options are endless""), but I am left feeling empty, tired, and pained, like an old soul ready to turn in my earthly body. 

I started taking antidepressants for the first time, starting about a month ago, and have experienced a few hours at a time of what other people likely experience as normalcy, where they don't can do routine things like shopping or taking public transport without having the urge to jump in front of the train, but I still keep going back to ""default mode"".

10kuxnm,1674639615,how to cope with being single?,True,"""Stand away from your sister and maybe men will come up to you""

I don't mean to be all gloom and doom here, I just need to vent. 

I'm surrounded by conventionally attractive women.. I'm not saying plus sized can't be conventionally attractive. In my situation, me being conventionally attractive isn't the case. Now I get it, I shouldn't be saying that about myself.. but quite frankly it's the truth. I've had family members, men, and strangers tell me how beautiful my sister is to my face. And act like I'm the messenger to tell her that these people are giving her compliments when she already knows. 

I shouldn't be this jealous, I'm 25 and should have a good grasp on self esteem. This is the heaviest I've weighed, and constantly being told to lose weight takes a damper on myself because people look at me like I'm a problem to be fixed. They think I don't take care of myself, maybe I don't. It's a hard concept to grasp that men would like me offline. When I go out men stay away like the departing of the red sea. 

A few years back when I really cared about online validation, I posted a photo of my sister and I.. and this was when I was thin. And I still got told I was ugly. Everyone was asking about her, calling her beautiful... saying no one would come up to me if she was around. In fact I got told that if someone wanted me they would be settling but would want to be with someone like her. She gets all sorts of men, football players, doctors, band mates.. I legit get nothing. I have to use dating apps to get noticed, otherwise when I'm out and about I don't get anything like conventionally attractive females would. 

I have all sorts of stories about my conventionally attractive friends and sisters. It's insane how different men treat you, I know how they look at them. Social media influences men into what they like. Now I understand why a man would go after them, they are beautiful they are fun to be around... they are attractive and fit. They have the whole package. I'm more soft spoken, quiet.. because I know if I spoke my mind people wouldn't take me seriously. 

This isn't a confidence issue, this is a obesity issue for me. Having to lose weight before a man would even think about being with me.. otherwise I'll get a man who is willing to settle for less for me. I know I'll be cheated on, I know that a guy would never fall in love with me. It's wild, when I'm with my conventionally attractive friends and sister it's insane how much attention they get. They get drinks bought for them, they get all sorts of stuff. 


I get ignored, my sister had a baby 7 months ago. I'm happily for her she's happily married but guys still hit on her. But I'm single and get literally nothing. I know I'll never be married, if he did he would be wishing he had someone beautiful. 


Thanks for listening to me. It's a jumbled and I know it's hard to follow, it's just depressing. I know I should confide in my therapist but at this point what's it going to change? I don't live in a facade.

If someone found me attractive or somewhat beautiful, they would've came up to me by now. I'm 25, I'm not young. I don't have my life together and time is zooming by. I have no redeeming qualities. I don't have a ""big chest"" or ""big behind"" to make up for anything.

I watch livestreams, and it's wild how attractive women are treated. Even men online want them lol. It's cause they know they look good. This one she talks about getting hit on a lot, like all the time ofkne. Something I'll never get. If beauty was subjective then why do they always get giddy or want conventionally attractive women first? Yeah bet you can't answer that. I've seen men point at my sister and show their friends infront of my face. Guys have whistled at her infront of me, even though these men were my age. 

Something confidence doesn't show. I'm scared that if I brought someone around he would want my sister or the model that comes to hang out in our friend group. You should see the men in the room their faces.. it's wild. They constantly stare and you can tell the women in the room become instantly insecure.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kuxnm/how_to_cope_with_being_single/,potatoex97,

10kt75k,1674632288,(27M) How do I accept that I will die alone?,True,"Yo.  


I'll start by saying that this isn't a post meant to ""whine"". I've (mostly) gone through the motions involving this discovery, given that I've always known, even at thirteen. I'll try to keep this as painless as possible, so please forgive me if I bore you or put you off.  


In short, I've never been in a relationship before. This isn't particularly shocking, given that I had a psychologically damaging upbringing, as well as being raised by a single, narcissistic mother. My ""father"" isn't dead or even suffering, he simply left to raise another woman's family. His absence, in combination with bullying, ADHD and various social and mental health issues have, in my opinion, irreparably damaged my psyche. Regardless, he's aware of me, and I'm aware of him. I won't be at his funeral.  


That's not to say that I haven't had crushes. I was a lot more awkward than the average teenager, but I do know how to make people laugh on occasion and keep in contact with people that I met in high school. These odd friendships led to me associating with girls, but some ridiculously strange part of me always stopped me from acting normal enough to just talk, or to try to be charming. That same part of me made it very clear that things like love and companionship were things that just weren't obtainable for someone like me. I didn't want to believe it, but the feeling hasn't lessened since I was a teenager, so I'm inclined to just believe it now.   


I've flip flopped millions of times over the years, going from being hopeful for the future to angry about my circumstances to being depressed and feeling ugly to a paranoid conspiracy theorist, and back again. I've interacted with many people, some if not most of whom think that I'm smart and will just ""figure it out"", but it never worked. My friends have gotten more dates using jokes that I tell them than I ever could. I'm not mad about it, but I don't think that I can change this dynamic, even if I were to go to a new place completely by myself.   


And so I'm here now. I'd like to know how to effectively give up on the idea of hooking up or getting a girlfriend. There a lot of people who tell others to ""just do"" things, but that implies that skills are simply inborn. Those people piss me off. What I want is to.... become asexual I guess? I don't mean to belittle or offend anyone, I'm just not very articulate.   


How would I be able to overcome my biological urges and just let myself grow old by myself? I'm comfortable with the idea of living alone, as I moved away to escape my family (Whom I also want to spite by dying as the last male with our name. I want my name to go extinct so that nobody has to deal with me or anyone like me again), but somewhere deep in me, I get depressed at the idea. I want to just accept it and go numb. Therapy isn't an option either, as by the time I make any headway in ""getting better"", I'll be a disgusting old man. I don't think 67 is the right age to get your first girlfriend.

10krjph,1674626102,I hope I live long enough that I get to kill myself,True,"Have you ever had a feeling of how you’re going to die? I always thought that the way that I would die would be by suicide. This thought did not bother me when I was younger; it still does not bother me now. I could have been desensitized to the idea because my grandparents, uncle and aunt all committed suicide. However, I don’t think I fully understood the pain that someone had to experience before deciding with all certainty that they want to die. That is until I experienced some of that pain myself. It is unimaginable suffering, and yet I am still here. I always knew in the back of my mind that I wouldn’t act on those thoughts, at least not at that moment. Don’t get me wrong, I think about dying every day and I hate being alive, but I am also curious about the future. I am young and just about to graduate from University. I have my whole life ahead of me. This is terrifying and exciting all at the same time. My curiosity about the future is what’s keeping me alive. Despite not wanting to kill myself right now I would like to kill myself in the future.

Suicide is tragic, but it is also brave. I certainly have not been brave enough to kill myself, I am too scared. I think that suicide can be horrible, terrible and tragic while at the same time being the most poignant act of individual agency, which I find beautiful. I hear people say “take your life into your own hands.” I do not think whoever said this meant to encourage suicide but I certainly took it that way, and literally. In this life, so many things are out of our control. Killing myself is one way that I can take control. I want to die on my own terms and by my own hand.

10krh6j,1674625837,It's been 3 years since my world fell apart,True,"In Fall 2019, I had it made.  I was in great physical shape, had finally lost my virginity, was at Harvard, and had some savings.  I was getting used to a new world, making new friends, and enjoying school for the first time in a long time.  The world was mine for the taking.  Here's how it falls apart:

**January 2020.**  The girl I'd been seeing for 4 months, who I'd lost my virginity to, has been seeing other guys the whole time.  I leave her, get back together, and she falls into love with me.  I loved her too, but it could never be the same after she cheated (she swears it wasn't cheating because ""we never discussed exclusivity"" but in my opinion it was).  I get sick with mono at this time too, just as COVID breaks out. Hair loss/balding begins as well.

**May 2020.** I graduated Harvard with a Master's via Zoom.  There were no relatives, ceremony...etc, but I had a loving gf, had accomplished a milestone in a hobby, and was seeing a therapist for the trauma.  I didn't have a job, though, and the pressure was on.  I had no friends, either, as we were in peak COVID and many had gone back home.

**August 2020.**  I left my loving but unfaithful gf to take a shit job across the country.  The new job didn't care about me, and I was reeling from the guilt and mixed feelings of the breakup.  My ex and I got back together long-distance, but it was turbulent.  I quit the bad job in November.  My ex and I broke up for the final time in Jan '21.

**January 2021.**  I was now single, with a new job lined up.  I went through a ho phase for 3 months.  Mixed experiences, but worthwhile.  The new job was even worse than the last.  Over 18 months, my boss has 7 of his 8 employees leave, the only holdout being his gf.  My spending starts to get out of control, as take-out is a coping mechanism.  The future looks bleak, and I stay in the job just to have something on my resumé.

**October 2021.** The job is atrocious, and I'm starting to gain weight.  Sleep problems worsen.  Too lonely to be happy, but too traumatized to date.  Money keeps running low as inflation increases.  My grandfather decides not to come to holidays anymore, as he is afraid of getting sick. 

**March 2022.**  My car is broken into.  My parents help recover some losses, but my financial woes continue as inflation persists.  The job, though briefly improved, starts to deteriorate again.  My longtime therapist gives up on me.  My lease expires and I start living in Airbnbs while looking for other jobs.

**May 2022.**  I finally get a graduation ceremony and return to Harvard.  I meet my ex, we apologize, but it doesn't make me feel healed.  Now very broke, and without a permanent place to live, I'm sleeping 3-4 hours/night.  Suicidal thoughts ramp up.

**August 2022.**  I get a new job.  My hair loss has subsided somewhat.  My physical conditioning improves, and I finally have some optimism.  Injuries undercut this enthusiasm, and my parents start getting weary of always supporting.  I'm seeing a sleep doctor, and insomnia improves with medication, but I'm now dependent on it for sleep.  My weight remains higher than I'd like, and I'm emotionally  mercurial from past experiences. Regular doctors, as usual, don't care.  Injuries linger.

**January 2023.** More injuries pile on.  My sleep, though once stabilized, is deteriorating again.  I have more money from my new job (and same spending habits) but am still just as broke.  I have lots of friends in different places, but I am very lonely and discouraged.  I'm now pigeonholed in an industry with no inspiration elsewhere.  I'm happier than in the past year, but still lost and aimless.  I wonder what the future holds and feel scared.  The new job is stressful and daily fear+loneliness makes it hard to function.  I question my ability to hold a job at all.

It seems like it hasn't been very long since I was on top of the world.  Honestly, though, it's been quite a while now.  I'd like to think that things would always have slipped anyway, as Harvard was never going to be a golden ticket even without a pandemic.  Still, I can't help but feel as if my world fell apart in 2020. It's not unique, I know.  I also know that many would trade places with me in a heartbeat.  Nothing is ever enough anymore, though, and every time I solve another issue, another one takes its place.

I’ve never been able to do what I want either because of my financial situation or because of my forced responsibilities. Recently me and my ex broke up and he was the only person to show me real love and actually help me see my worth but also the same person who said I was too much for him. I’ve decided to make a plan and follow it until I’m ready to go. Im going to revert to hiding all my feelings and pretend to be so healed and renewed. Smile so bright and get back into all the activities I used to enjoy doing. Take extra care into my looks and surroundings. Make new friends and go partying. Always with this huge grin that I’ve been practicing for weeks on perfecting. And then when everyone thinks im doing amazing and fantastic I’m gonna up and claim I’m moving away. That’s when I’ll go and jump off some sort of bridge. I realize that no one actually cares about me. But they don’t want the burden of my depression and death so they try and convince me that i matter to them. But I know the truth. The real truth is the same reason my ex broke up with me. When im being the real me, it’s too much. Too much pain and trauma to be around. Too much hurt and sad stories. Not enough joy and prancing and giggling. I can never be the true me around anyone because im too damaged. The sad thing is I’m actually way better then back then. So to find out I’m still not healed enough to be properly loved is too much for me to handle. So I hope everyone enjoys the fake happy me, the joyous, always giggling me. The me before I’m ready to go. I know they will, but im going to show them, that even when you hid it. It doesn’t go away. I’m going to do something for myself this time. No matter what anyone says.

I (21F) am three years deep into a depressive episode with several bouts of hospitalization, a variety of antidepressant trials, and one round of ECT under my belt. I struggle with severe suicidal ideation.

I am at yet another stopping point.

I've been slowly deteriorating for several months now but holding out hope that with a medication change, I can push through. However, since the start of the semester, I am unable to complete/start my schoolwork, I skip my internship nearly every day, and I call into work every other shift. I feel like an utter failure and a huge burden on my family and boyfriend.

I've already decided to drop school, as it causes me the most stress. My job and internship are likely going to be put on hold as well. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have amazing parents who are more than willing to let me move back home for the time being and help me figure out my next steps, but I don't even know where to begin. I just wish I wasn't here.

Medication isn't helping. My psychiatrist doesn't want me to undergo another round of ECT. I'm considering looking into an inpatient treatment program for depression, but I'm having trouble finding anything that looks legit.

10kpjcj,1674619355,Just burnt out. And not sure where to post this,True,"I’m six months in to my post grad school career and I’m just burnt out. Over it. Sick of working.

Idk where this post belongs tbh, i think it’s a mix of my anxiety and depression and general global climate currently but I feel like a let down of life.

I have this “passion” based career helping people that many people dream of and tell me how great it is.

Tbh I wish I could not have to talk and interact and put out such energy bc I come away so exhausted, depleted and irritable. I come home and just sleep. Then get up just to work again.
And even after doing everything “right” as I was told to make it, I can’t afford to even move away from my parents house has a 30 year old. 

Life feels like a farce. What am I continuing on in this for? I wanna just quit and pick potatoes all alone for a living. 

Sorry this is long and only somewhat related to anxiety, but I feel “on” all day and as an introvert with strong nihilistic tendencies I just don’t care.

And if ur wondering I work w the dying, it sounded and seemed so passion filler to be in a helping field …but in reality I did it bc I felt like it’s the only thing I “can” do and know how to do. I’d rather not do any of it and be a blob.

I'll be as brief and simple as possible -

I'm currently married (fifteen years now). We married because we got back together after a few years of being apart, and I decided that I never wanted to be without her again. I would never leave my family, as they would never do anything so terrible for that to ever even be an option, I just want to make that clear right away.

I just feel so worthless right now, I feel like the world's biggest loser, I feel like a complete idiot and my self-esteem feels like it's going down the toilet. I was just going through all my Facebook stuff from the past (it's not much, I'm a very basic, normal person) but, this one comment on my timeline made me sit straight up, I got lightheaded, my stomach felt like it was going to fly up and out of skull - a comment from the girl I was trying to flirt with before my wife moved back and wanted to get back together - it simply says ""where have you been all my life!?""

Now I'm questioning everything lol. Like I said, it's been so long since 2007, I don't know this woman anymore, she doesn't know me, BUT, I NEVER saw that post. I don't know what the fuck I was doing, but for THAT comment to just slip by me, for me to NEVER have seen it until now???????????

But my life is in turmoil at the same time. Im conscious of how im fucking up my life one thing at a time. I moved schools so much when i was younger because there was always a better one around the corner so i never learnt how to make deep connections with anyone and as a result of that I’m so fucking lonely. Ive had suicide on my mind for the past couple of years and i have no one to talk to. I have no real friends i feel like the background character in my own life.

I did however tell my parent recently and my dad told me to get over it and how I’m just faking it and how depression isn’t real and my mum said she understood but now throws it my face anytime i do anything self diminishing and i hate myself for ever telling them. 

I also hate the way i look, to put it bluntly I’m not obese or even overweight and not to those are bad things but I’m classically just bigger 5 kgs away from overweight.  

My parent always put so much importance on education it rules my life  the pressure is so bad but i see people having it worse in every aspect if everyone of my problems and i feel like i don’t deserve to feel bad or feel depressed.

So i live in this constant state of sadness but not deserving to feel sad this sense of entitlement but also feeling like i don’t deserve it there’s just so much i want to say but have never had any really outlet and theres something deep down that  says dont go to a therapist or a counsellor because their for people with real problems.

ik it's stupid to focus on how u look this much and i wish i could stop but i really can't. i was always a chubby kid and i grew up to be a kinda chubby, my parents called me fat all my life and it led me to start dieting when i was very young since i felt guilty about eating, so it's always like this, i diet, stop and diet again blablabla. im actually on a diet right now and it's going really good so i thought my self esteem would better but no.

yesterday my parents, my brother and i met another family at an event and there was a girl maybe around my age with them, skinny super pretty i even told her she looked pretty but tbh i don't think she heard me. anyway, my parents were complimenting her telling her she looked like a model and all that and it made me feel so gross and bad about myself since i hate how i look and apparently they do too. today they were praising my brother because he got a lot of compliments on how he looked and once again i was just there feeling like crap.

i always hear to not let things get to u but they really do get to me, tbh i can handle being called a bad person more than being called fat.

i get a lot of compliments on social media but once i get even just one bad thing said i delete everything and disappear to later come back skinnier and prettier cause i starved myself but it doesn't last long.

I am so narcissistic and I only think of myself, that’s why I don’t have any friends. I can just see the way people look at me as if I’m a freak. I kind of felt this way for most of my life, but it got much worse when the gender identity issues exploded in college. Now, a few years later, I’ve managed to graduate and get a good job. But I’ve never felt so unhappy before. It just gets worse every day and I sink deeper and deeper into depression. 

I go to work, do my best while struggling to talk to anyone, and then go home and get in bed. I spend the weekends in bed. I feel my energy slipping away and it’s like I’m just existing with no purpose. And it feels like what I want. I want to just curl up in a ball and sleep for the rest of eternity. I don’t want to talk to anyone ever. I feel so uncomfortable just being alive. I hate the stupid fantasies of being a woman when I know it’s hopeless because I am truly a man in every way. The shame of this along with how useless and boring of a person I am just makes me despise myself. I really really hope there’s no afterlife or reincarnation. I want it to end for good after this life. I just want to rest forever.

I’ve never had a single close friend in my entire life. I never connected with anyone outside of being an acquaintance at school and helping people study. I just never felt like I was being myself with anyone, not even my own family. Now I have no friends period, and im not even sure I want any. I would feel so uncomfortable talking to someone else within my personal life. Why do I feel so ashamed of my own existence and everything I do? I can’t even get the motivation to see a therapist, and I know they’d just blame everything on the gender stuff and give me pills that won’t help.

I tried asking if she needed some space or wanted to be friends for now or whatever but she didn't seem to know, so we kept talking for a few weeks with mixed results, sometimes she talked normally, sometimes she left me on read and sometimes she was just pretty cold with me.

When she didn't seem to want to talk I'd usually tell her I was going to give her some space ( so she didn't think I'd just left her), but one time I did this she said I wasn't being fair on her to keep leaving, so I explained how I felt I was bothering her and she just apologised to me saying how hard things were for her right now (this was about a week before christmas)

We spoke a few times after that and we wished eachother well for christmas, but then she left me on read again afterwards, I tried checking in with her 10 days later and she never opened my message (picture of the sunset she used to like) and then I messaged her again telling her a story about my dog on the beach yesterday (just over 2 weeks since my last message)

I assumed with her getting upset about me giving her space that she still wanted to talk, but then she seemed to have randomly ghosted me for about a month? I can't tell if it's just the depression or if she doesn't care about me anymore/doesn't want to talk to me

10knrl3,1674614062,4 out of 5 people with depression experience sleep issues before the onset of depression,True,"The loss of slow-wave sleep–the most restorative phase of slumber–can directly account for many of depression’s most debilitating features. Not surprisingly, **before the onset of depression, four out of five people suffer from some form of sleep disturbance**.

The implications are clear: Anything we can do to improve our sleep can help combat depression and render the disorder less likely to occur in the future.” - Dr. Ilardi, PhD at The University of Kansas

Fear not if you have sleep problems like I do, Dr. Ilardi presents a plan in Chapter 9 of his book The Depression Cure:

*“What leads to restorative slow-wave sleep?*

* *Physical exercise…*
* *Bright light exposure…*
* *Omega-3 supplementation…*
* *Anti-ruminative activity.*

*Condition your body to fall asleep when it gets into bed with these:*

* *Use the bed only for sleeping…*
* *Get out of bed when you’re not sleepy…*
* *Get up at the same time every day…*
* *Don’t take naps…*
* *Avoid bright light at night…*
* *Keep lights dim an hour before bedtime and limit electronics…*
* *Avoid caffeine and other stimulants past 12 pm…*
* *Avoid alcohol at night…*
* *Keep the same bedtime every night…*
* *Turn down your thermostat about 5 degrees an hour before bedtime…*
* *Turn off your mental chatter.”*

- having a job
- eating enough (and not all at once)
- taking care of my basic household tasks

That’s my paradigm. That’s what I aim for each day. “Don’t quit your job”, “eat a few reasonable meals”, and “for the love of god wash your fucking sheets”. Years of therapy, pulling myself out numerous mental mires, “doing my best”, etc. - here I am now. 

I show up to work and proceed to butcher nearly every interaction. I’m using every cognitive resource I have available to string together a proper sentence while performing rote mechanical labor - then oops! another mistake. It’s reminiscent of one of those openly rigged prize claw games you find at cheap diners and big box grocery stores. Only in place of money, I insert my hope. Then, instead of watching a knock-off plushie slip through the intentionally feeble fingers of the scam claw, it’s my fucking energy, my optimism, my drive. 

I ask myself, “what is it that I want?” and there’s a laundry list of desires. It’s when I ask, “why do I want it?” that I feel like I’m just a tired archetype - Disillusioned disabled person. It’s like, it’s not even novel. I have all my basic needs met. I should be grateful, but I’m not. I want to feel capable, I want to feel competent, I want to feel normal.

I've been dealing with depression for about 7 years now. I have gone through all different phases of depression and ways to deal with it. I at first thought I couldn't kms, so I went for a third party choice like either; getting run over by bus/train, getting so unfit I can have a heart attack or disease, started smoking ciggies to get cancer. I tried many options to die but none are really working. I have slowly been getting lower in depression swings to the point last year I tried to kms roughly 3 times but by strangling myself. I know the human body doesn't allow you to do so but for some reason I still try.  I have gotten to the point where I'm genuinely considering why I am still alive.

We’ve known each other forever but things only got serious this summer. 

I’ve had depression since I was 14 and it comes and goes and fluctuates how bad it is. I experienced an sa about 2 years ago and that really made everything worse. 
I’m at university 2 hours away and he has a 9-5 back home. 
Since being at uni my mental health has plummeted.
I’ve quit my job, I can’t do any of my uni work and struggle with the most basic things. 

Now we’re long distance it’s easy to hide this from him, I tell him I’m not doing great but he doesn’t see the extent of how bad. 

We spoke about my struggles with mental health when I called it off during the summer. We then tried again because we really missed each other.
For context, he is the loveliest, most gentle boy I’ve ever met and I absolutely adore him. He drives up to meet me whenever he can. He’s my best friend 

I’m currently in the worst depressive episode I’ve had in years. Suicidal thoughts are back and I’m self harming. He doesn’t know any of that. 
He knows it’s bad, worse than it has been but not how bad. 
I’m so numb, I can’t care about anything or cry. Most days I just sleep. I feel like a leech on everyone in my life, that I only hurt people. I feel like I’m just not a good person and the list goes on.

I struggle to talk to anyone when I’m like this, I don’t want to call or text and if I do I’m no fun. I know he’s struggling with me being closed off but I don’t want him to know how dark it is. When I have tried to say something he just says ummm and I understand he feels awkward or doesn’t know what to say.

He says he’s experienced depression before but he just stayed positive and he was okay. That’s so far from where I’m at I just know he wouldn’t understand and I’m scared him knowing how bad I feel, I’ll lose him. 
But at the same time I feel like a terrible girlfriend and that he deserves better.

I've kept a deep resentment that I can never explain. There was a turning point between telling her the truth or just ending it. I can't decide so my resentment has taken over me and verbally hurt her so badly that can no longer talk to her. Guilt had overwhelmed me and let time goes by not thinking of the consequences. I did not try to fix it and left her. Even at this point I still think of that night I left without noting her. We met again after six months of being gone for an official closure. She's a completely different person from the one I have loved so much. It has shattered my entire world. 

I blame myself for literally killing that person who has loved me so much for four years. I grieved for days, it was the worst experience of all. Now our years of memories haunt me, it just kept getting worse. Every nightfall of thoughts of a future without her and a cycle of hope for a reconciliation. I can't bear the thought of her being with someone else, it's a knife that cuts through flesh. I did this to myself, I deserve this. 

I desperately wanted to go back to that same night we fought and wish that I should have just relented and tried my best to fix us. I'm obsessing about that moment so much that I no longer care about the future with myself alone. Best moments with her flash in front of my eyes randomly. It's visceral and alive like there is nothing else that matters but those moments. I barely have a self to love. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I just see a precious but incomplete relic of the past. One without it's another most important half. I burnt everything that reminds her so that I can move on faster, turns out I alone remind me of her. It's terrible, every day is terrible, and nothing but pain and mental breakdowns. The feeling of pain reminded me of what was important in my life and what I have lost.

10kkbwj,1674604477,"I feel so stuck, but I'm trying",True,"Hi, I'm 21 at the time of writing this, I just want to vent a little, especially since I feel like I'm making some progress. 

I know I was depressed since I was about 13, but I was never diagnosed and because I was scared of being sent to a psych ward I would constantly say I wasn't. I've had alot of stuff happen to me in my life and it had a big effect. 

Last year I got a better job, one with a better insurance plan that at least let me go to the doctor and not break the bank. I brought up that I was having some issues and what has happened to me and was told I needed a therapist, but that my doctor was pretty sure I was depressed and had PTSD, based on the experiences I told her I was having. 

I haven't been to a therapist yet, while looking for one I realized my insurance doesn't cover that and I just can't afford it right now, so I was giving up on that.  However, I had a mental break, then almost the exact next week I had a panic attack so bad I went to the ER because of the chest pain. 

The ER DR. prescribed me antidepressants at a light dosage until my next Dr. appointment and apparently to others around me they think it's working. 

My hygiene routine has been spotty for years, my room spends more time cluttered than not, I wear the same simple clothes over and over (yes they are washed but it's always the same shirts and pants) I never cared what my hair looked like and barely brushed it, I spent the majority of my time asleep or under my blankets, I haven't done any of my hobbies in at least 2 years, and I've almost ended myself several times. 
My work started to get spotty and I'd call out on days I felt like one harsh wind would be enough to rip me in two. I was falling apart. 

Things felt insurmountable. Things that take little effort and little time felt like climbing Mt. Everest, and I was so convinced that things that took only a few minutes would take me all day. It made me tired to think about and I had no motivation for anything.  

I've been on the medication for a month now, I was skeptical because I didn't want to become addicted or reliant on a pill, but the ER DR. reassured me that it's not as bad as the propaganda out there and sometimes we just need a little help. 

I could always just stop taking it so I didn't have much to loose. 

I've slowly started trying to take better care of myself. I started brushing my hair, I'm saving up the money to get some new clothes I actually like instead of the holey t-shirts, I've picked up cooking, and started to get back to what I used to like, I've actually enjoyed cleaning my room and preferred it clean, I haven't called out once in the past 3 weeks, and I made a list  of things I want to accomplish.

It's not all good. The medication wasn't a fix all and it doesn't stop me from feeling what I've felt for years, but I feel more, not better but definitely less like the very skin on my bones needed to be ripped off. 

More like, where before I was drowning at the bottom of an abyss, I'm still drowning but I'm more free floating under the surface rather than being chained to the bottom. I'm trying I'm not better not by a long shot and there are days I fall back into old habits or thought patterns but I'm trying to be better. 

My motivation for things has gone up and my reactions to people or things is less horrible than it was, but it didn't change the dark thoughts, and there are days I just want to give up and say it's not worth the effort- after all I have never expected to live past 30 and I still dont, but I'm trying very hard to see the world in a better light. 

I want to see the world like I used to, I want to be able to draw again and enjoy it, and I want to be able to see how vibrant the world is again, but it seems so far away, but I can admit I've moved slightly from the place I was at, and I just have to wonder if one day I can actually smile again.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kkbwj/i_feel_so_stuck_but_im_trying/,Successful-Aerie7503,

I've reverted to using plastic utensils and paper plates when I can, so I don't have to wash dishes. I've made my meals smaller to compensate for the lack of physical activity. I just... lost all my energy. It vanished ever since I wrote my will. I try to talk as little as possible and my vocabulary has reduced to single word replies most of the time.

Yet my family is as bright as can be. They've taken over the tasks I used to do. They're bringing my laundry to my room, they toss out my trash so it doesn't pile up, and wash the few dishes that I still use (I work from home and eat meals at my desk). Usually my mom would ask for my help with the printer but now she's relying on my brother to do it instead. I... used to handle my grandma's problems, even when there's nothing actually 'wrong' because of the dementia. If I step foot in her room with the way I'm feeling now - I'm instantly filled with a suffocating dread. So my family goes in my place for me. I even tried to go in there today, to help her turn the captions off on her TV. I knew it'll hurt but I thought I should try. My mom stopped me and said she'll handle it. 

Ha. In the middle of writing this post, my grandma came barging in my room talking about a phone call (mind you she doesn't own a cell phone anymore LOL so idk what she's even talking about). My mom quickly came up and diffused the whole thing. She knows I'll be put through more pain dealing with it on my own.

This all makes me feel like how I did when I graduated college with no stable job. I'm useless again. Life carries on, my family supports me unconditionally, while I'm paralyzed from my own twisted thoughts. My horribly sick, stupid, dumb fucking head. Oh, how I hate my head.

My family at least deserves the version of me who acts happy for appearance's sake. I can't even pull that off anymore.

I don't deserve any of this. They're too nice.

Lately, I just look forward to laying in bed in pure isolation. I stay on my phone. I can't bring myself to enjoy video games anymore.

She went on a solo trip abroad with their dog, fell there and most likely had some internal bleeding and died in a parking lot in her (he doesn't know what exactly happened to her, he didn't want to know, which I understand). The police were searching for her for nearly a week, it was very difficult. Felt and still feels very unreal.
Our relationship is long-distance. I was there, when his dad came to tell him they'd found her. He lived only with his mum in a huge 2-story house. His parents are divorced and his dad lives in another part of the city with his sister. He now has to take care of the house and the dog, of course with the help of them, but it's still so much work. He also struggles with money, has to cook for himself and he's a student. He is still just a child, I am of his age and I certainly don't feel like I could handle all that at all. I myself did not take his mum's death well.
He feels hopeless, alone and empty without any guidance. I try to help as much as possible, we see eachother other at least 2 times a month for a weekend or so and we're in contact 24/7. It pains me so much to see him suffer like this. 
Tonight, he hurt himself very badly, I think as an attempt to unalive himself (he wasn't able to speak very clearly, so I'm not 100% sure). He called his dad and I stayed on the line until I knew he's safe with dad. 
He's so depressed. He's been even before her death, but he was actively working on it and doing a great job. I really don't know how much else to help. I am trying my best.

10ki31g,1674598784,Differentiating between depression vs outright laziness/hopelessness,True,"Tl;dr: not sure if this is normal or common. Is trying out antidepressants worth a try to see if my life/personality improves?


For a bit of context: 

I went to the Dr because I am officially fed up with my poor sleep. It takes hours upon hours of me laying down before I can fall asleep; whether I’ve been able to sleep in the night before or got 2 hours of sleep before a long day, same thing. Brain just doesn’t turn off. 

Anyway, I was referred to a behavioral health specialist to consider treatment for anxiety that prevents my mind that never slows down. After speaking with her for an hour, she called my dr to set up a medication consultation, saying based on my responses and general dialogue I have “moderate anxiety and severe depression” 


Now I have never thought myself to have depression. But it got me thinking. I used to spend all my days out with friends, riding bikes, playing sports, video games, etc through high school. But for the last ~7 years, looking back, I have no interest in doing anything. I can’t even think of a hobby that I have. Nothing I’m passionate about, no aspirations. When people ask to hang out I lie and say I have work so I can be alone. I wear dirty clothes until they noticeably smell. My car has needed an oil change over 3k miles ago. I can list more examples but you probably get the point. 

I always thought I just have a boring personality. That I’m a person with no interests who’s just fine with floating through life until it finally ends. Could this just be depression? My lack of a desire to improve myself, move forward in life, etc? 

Nothing brings me genuine joy, nor makes me enthusiastic. Everything takes all my motivation and energy; just to clean the dishes or grocery shop. 


And is it not just normal for everyone a few times a month to wish for the lights to just go out? I don’t have a plan or desire to hurt myself or end my life, but often I do wonder why continue? Death would just be *easier* no stress, work, expectations. Life is simply exhausting. 

More often than not- the majority of time, I’m *fine*. But this lyric does resonate greatly: “I don’t think I’m suicidal but if I was I won’t admit it. I’d be okay with dying if I’m not the one who did it”

my grades went from 80-90s to the 70s. i don’t reach out to half my friends anymore and i just cancel most plans. i can barely sit down and draw which is my number 1 passion without losing interest and going to play games (which doubly hurts because i need to do work for art major portfolio). i cant sleep at the right time anymore. i barely shower or leave my room. i don’t trust people again which fucking sucks because i’ve been working so hard the past year to be okay around people. i asked the person i was seeing if we could just stay friends because i couldn’t put any effort in, and losing touch with most emotions meant losing touch with loving them. i don’t talk to my mom about these things because there’s not really much she can do to help, and i’m already in therapy. i should probably talk to my therapist about but we just barely started scratching the surface of my trauma from peers treating me like shit growing up.

i feel like im just failing everything all over again. like i’m throwing away my life but i just cant bring myself to care. i cant even get myself to do things for the sake of future me i just dont do anything. i have a session with my portfolio tutor next week which i already delayed and i still barely have anything done to show her. i just want to feel calm and normal about life again",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kgumt/i_want_to_care_about_the_things_i_love_17nb/,fartcicle1234,

10kgj3n,1674595048,i haven't had a friend in two year and i'm convinced it won't happen,True,"like title says, i'm an autistic 18 year old who hasn't had a friend in two years, and even back then i don't know if they were much friends. as we never did anything and i spent most of my time in my room rotting away, just like now, i never got to experience that typical teenage life filled with friends, parties and risk. it's always been just me and my room.   


i've tried making new friends but no one wants to. i got into clubs that i was interested in, people either ignore me or they just remain acquaintances for years. i always see cool punk/rock people that are; my age, in my area and surrounded by a bunch of other like-minded friends, but i NEVER see any of those sort of people with my own eyes, where are they? they always seem like the most easy going and accepting people yet they all seem to not exist. not to even mention how it seems that our society is built to isolate already isolated people. everyone recommends the most braindead ideas like: oh but go to the club and meet people. yes, let me go to the club with loud awful music alone so i can meet people who are nothing like me and i despise. every single person who gives advice or says they know how to fix it all seem so disconnected from my reality.   


when people who are surrounded by friends and living my dream life complain, i want to put my hands around their neck and strangle them, how can they be such idiots and not realise that they have the most viable thing? this is my incorrect reaction, as they have all the right to complain and feel bad about other stuff in their life, but i do wonder how people who have all the friends i didn't can feel so bad? is it possible to feel good?   


from what i've seen the two most common ways by far to find friends are either through school or through already existing friends. i get relentlessly bullied and pushed around in my school, so i'm forced to study from home with Microsoft Teams, it works fine for my studies but i don't leave my house anymore and i can't make friends at school. i can't meet new people through already existing friends because well, i don't have friends. it seems like i'm doomed to just stay alone.   


when i see people, i sometimes getting really strong thoughts about begging for their help. i want them to save me and for them to bring me back from oblivion. i don't want to be a prisoner of my own room, but there is nothing out there right now that's meaningful in anyway if i'm alone.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kgj3n/i_havent_had_a_friend_in_two_year_and_im/,Tonysonabanana,

I'm trying to get my tubes tied but due to a nursing shortage, it's been cancelled. I'm married and I never want to have sex. I can't even think about it. I can't stop everything on my mind for ten minutes with my partner. I feel like I can't be who I was when I met him. I'm not 22 anymore. So much life has happened to me and I can't confide in anyone except my therapist. I can't get a job. I'm a dog walker/sitter and my long time dog is getting put down in two weeks, my last visit with him is tomorrow. This is my job, my only way to make income. Whenever I have a real job I quit because I have panic attacks in front of customers. It's so fucking embarrassing. I hate having to control my diet, my meds, my mood, my back pain, my constant anxiety, my debilitating depression, the urges to off myself. It doesn't feel worth it, I never really has.

nobody knows just how terrible I feel all the time

i don't make enough money for therapy and i desperately, DESPERATELY need it. why is it so expensive?? why is it so inaccessible?? it's almost like it's intended that way

i stopped taking my antidepressants cause i gained 45 pounds in 3 years despite no changes in my habits. i know i shouldn't have but im scared because my weight is such a huge insecurity and seeing myself just sets my depression off even more. it's so hard to get refills too since i can't have my parents know i'm on antidepressants (they're anti-mental healthcare and think it's just to get young people hooked on drugs)

i saw a poorly made meme about middle school bullying and it actually genuinely triggered me. i'd never had a reaction like that before. it unlocked a bunch of memories i wasn't ready ti unpack and i was sobbing at my desk for half an hour, asking myself why nobody ever helped me. it's been 10 years and im still not over it. i thought i was but today proved otherwise

10kfbxd,1674592168,Needing advice (19M trying to figure out the adult world),True,"Hello. I am not so sure this is the right place to talk about this because I don't think my mental health is TERRIBLE but... here is me: I'm a socially anxious guy in his first semester of college, yet I feel like I am stuck in youth, as in...I feel dependent; maybe like a burden. Here's one thing: I am still learning to drive and sometimes I feel annoying having to ask for a ride to class. I am sort of insecure about it because my town is conservative and all the guys basically seem like grown men. I used to be seen as that nerdy scrawny quiet kid (I've been told the opposite lately and that I am attractive and kind, so it seems I got rid of that image but sometimes it still bothers me) Although many of my classmates went on to bigger universities, I chose to stay home (small town America) because I thought I would be happier with my family. I also felt like I was doing myself and my family a favor. I wouldn't have to worry about super expensive university costs and whatnot. And I do love my family. I am lucky to have a middle class family who looks out for me.   
Sometimes though, I wonder if I've been too pampered to be mature. I look at other people my age and they seem much happier in life. They are partying, going out, and at the same time are able to balance that fun life with schoolwork. I feel like I am missing out but I'm afraid my grades will drop  if I were to do those things and I think a lot of my happiness stems from exceptional grades..and making my family proud with those grades (it's always been this way since I was young)  
My older sibling told me once that I need to ""grow up and become my own person already;"" that most people had done that by the time they were 14. They are right. I do not feel like my own person. It's hard for me to make big decisions for myself. Like whether to transfer to a university. Will I make my family sad? I think I would be sad too? Sometime's I just feel like a kid. I feel small compared to other people. My classmates already know what career they want and where they are going next in life. When I am asked my plans? I just kind of stutter and go with something. ""Oh you must really enjoy chemistry then,"" they respond. Well not necessarily, I just to be able to have a stable income and I want to say something impressive because I do strive to be respectable.  Overall, I feel like I'm taking baby steps when I need to be taking ""adult steps.""   
When my parents were my age, they were dating and married a few years later. They are happy to this day. They also were working and driving at a very young age. Why do I get nervous even thinking about working in retail? Do I NEED a job as an antisocial teen with a college schedule? Or should I just focus on graduating with my associates first? I don't want to seem lazy or like I am mooching off my parents. I just feel like so inexperienced at everything. I used to have a friend who said that I need to put on my ""big boy pants"" and quit being a b\*tch. (I kind of stopped talking to them). They had a different home life than me though so maybe they matured better than me? I have a good relationship with them and I am always helping with chores and extra things.   
I hope I don't sound silly. I just want to be more dependent, more secure with myself, and somewhat sociable. Maybe my old friend was right. I would love some advice.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10kfbxd/needing_advice_19m_trying_to_figure_out_the_adult/,watchcheckup,

So i’ve been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, ADHD. 
I’ve tried all the SSRIs and SNRIs (&amp; wellbutrin) under the sun, but either they didn’t work, or I experienced major side effects. 
Like many of you here, I was anxiously looking for other solutions, incessantly browsing through this subreddit and other ones similar to it. 
Finally, my mom suggested suggested me a psychiatrist who she’d been to earlier, claiming that this guy knew what he was doing. 
I wasn’t expecting much out of the new psych, but I did visit him anyway since mom had already booked an appointment. 
Pristiq was the only one I had not yet tried, so I asked him if I could just try Pristiq. He suggested that instead of an SNRI, I try a combination of a primarily serotonergic (SSRI- Lexapro) and primarily noradrenergic drug (TCA- Aventyl). 
I was hesitant to try Lexapro since I’d already been on it with no improvements but he wanted me to try it for exactly 1 week and let him know if I had any sides. Anyway, I experienced some side effects- mainly nausea and emotional blunting. 
He said that the side effects would go away after a month or so, but I was hesitant, and so we switched to Trintellix. We did not change Aventyl, since I didn’t experience any side effects. However, he said that had I experienced any side effects, he would’ve tried me on Desipramine next. (I was aggressive for the first 2 weeks on Aventyl but that went away eventually)

After being on the medications for exactly a month and half, I noticed that whenever an anxious thought crossed my mind, my chest muscles did not tense. I could literally feel them trying to tense up, but not being able to. My sleep was better- I slept for exactly 8 hours every night like clockwork, and the quality of my sleep was so so much better. While depressed, sleeping was quite literally my favourite hobby. However, I noticed I did not want to sleep as much anymore. And if I tried falling asleep during the day, I was no more able to. It was this weird feeling of being well-rested. 
Anyway, due to my forgetfulness, I eventually stopped taking Trintellix 3 months back, and did not refill my prescriptions anymore either. I have had no withdrawal symptoms, and Aventyl alone has been working wonders for my MDD and GAD. In my perspective, I’m currently peaking at life- making friends everywhere I go, switched to Honors in university, holding a part-time job, playing sports again, and I also just started writing a book that I’m looking to publish. 

Anyway, for those of you who’ve trialed on hundreds of medications and given up, I’d suggest you guys to give the combo of an SSRI (or Trintellix/Viibryd) &amp; TCA (Nortriptyline/Desipramine) a try. I mean, what worked for me might not work for everyone else, but it doesn’t hurt to try, does it?

Additionally, I was on Lamotrigine and then Pregabalin as a last resort before seeing the new psychiatrist, but eventually stopped taking those because I thought they didn’t work. But looking back now, I think they worked better than everything else, but I’d still say nothing has worked better than the combination I’m currently on. 

Anyway, feel free to reach out to me if you guys want to know more; I’m obviously no doctor, and a doctor’s advice always supersedes some random redditor’s suggestion.

10kerr6,1674590844,Lack of motivation because of people around triggering it,True,"I'm not a fan of posting anything about my mental health on the internet because no one cares and there is no point in doing it but I will do it regardless for myself rather then random people.

Right now I'm working on my license driver exam and profession exam (profession exam for the 4th time now), they don't go exactly smoothly but I'm trying to stay cold about it to reduce a stress, for both I study very hard and mostly putting my free time away for studying. Even thou I didn't passed any of those for the past 6 months, I'm trying my best to pass them eventually.

Unfortunately, there are certain people around me that greatly demotivate me. We talking about my family. They always come up with words like ""You should learn more"", ""If you ain't gonna pass this exam, you will never find a job"", ""You have 2 months before passing, otherwise I kick you out of the house"" etc.

I know they love me and mean no harm but without any friends or any their person that isn't mine family, I would really appreciate words that would motivate me like ""You doing great!"" or ""You've done what you could, good work!"" or something like that.

I have certain disability that causes mine left side of brain work differently or less effective them mine right side of a brain, I was told it's called ""Aphasia"" and this is what my family claim's but I'm not sure is it true. I googled it and it is speech oriented and fact is I have problem to speak my native language but I'm not sure. Officially it's called like that on my papers and yes I have a disability card and with aphasia cause on those papers.

With mine problem, it's harder to learn certain things. For example; learning math, languages, grammar and etc. Are harder drastically, way way easier are like art focused things or like driving a car things to learn and etc, maybe that is why I went for Photography School as a profession?

Anyway I'm trying still to pass every exam I have but with people around demotivating me it's starting to be getting really hard.

I also really struggle to find a job. since March of 2022, I've applied for 200+ jobs in my area, unfortunately no calls were made towards mine person. I also live in really rural part of mine country, that is Silesia Poland on the most bottom part of Viodoship. The nearest town Is like 8km away from me but in this small town, there is maybe 5 available jobs to be applied for (Right now). the Nearest big town is 80km away and this might not sound so big especially if you are American but with mine struggle to get license driver (That is very hard in Poland and takes time and money) and lack of public transport there it's a great trip to take on for me.

Sometimes I feel like I am a lost cause. Of course this is not a case because I'm a young healthy person with some passion that is my profession; Photography but I have really no one to talk about it or to be begin with, talk about anything matter a fact so I think it's healthy to think about some bad things (Maybe not healthy but normal). I'm trying to stay positive matter a fact but sometimes I just can't cope with anything, even with food because in my house, my parents always are strict with food.

Since I lost my dear friend in 2014, I've never recover from it. My only friend I had and only person I would share things with as same as my emotions. Maybe mine attempted suicide in 2018 was some people would call a ""milestone"" in my life and being so close to the end really broke something in me. Right now I value my life and learn to never give up because I will never gain nothing with that point. I lost people dear to me, Grandma, Grandpa, mine Grand-grandma, uncle, Adrian mine dear friend but those are not worse then mine own death because without me, there will be nothing and now at least I've got to feel and be dreaming about my dreams that I hope someday will come true by myself that myself motivated me. I might not have supportive family, I might not have a friends, I might be absolutely miserable at some points and loose hope but I think that's okay. We do those things sometimes and this isn't something that is weird or uncool or whatever negative motive I can put there, I think this even might be something that makes us sometimes, or maybe not. When I type this now maybe I'm not talking truth. Maybe I'm really just trying to cope with my feelings right now, I honestly don't know no more.

Maybe some day I will make my dream true and pass mine all exams I've got and find a job, if not I don't know. I should think I will not, I should keep on trying until I succeed. But sometimes I just want to talk about it, and I have no one to talk about it and I think I haver no option if I want to talk about it by putting those words on the internet.

I mean that *everything* I do has some sort of deep rooted selfish motive that either makes everything end in disaster, or make me feel insanely guilty about doing anything. I'm aware of what psychological egoism is, I know that it is inherent human nature to put myself before others, but I genuinely believe that I have it so much worse than others. I ask people how they're doing only because I wish to be asked back. I help people out and compliment them only because I expect them to return the favor. If they don't, I feel like I wasted my time and that I didn't get any use out of it. I hate how I was born to be this way, to see everyone else as a puppet and to interact with them only if I can benefit from it. This sort of mindset drives me into despair when I can't get any use out of someone, and places unbearable guilt on my shoulders when I reflect upon what I did. I don't fucking know how to change this mindset. I've always been this way and it's always been extremely prominent in my nature. I'm tired of being that piece of shit that everyone stays away from, the person ""radiating negative energy"" that everyone is told to get the fuck away from so that they can surround themselves with positive energy instead. I know it's better for everyone else to never even acknowledge my existence but I depend on validation from others to stay emotionally stable, so our needs really aren't compatible. This is a very frustrating dilemma to be in and I know it's easy just to tell me to ""change my behavior"" but my brain circuitry is wired in a way that doesn't allow to me override shitty habits with better ones. 

It's been months since I've been abandoned by the only friends I've ever had. I can't stand having nobody to talk to. I can't stand myself for always managing to scare off whoever I attempt to establish relationships with. I wish I could go one day without these same thoughts returning to torture me, become more painful every time.

Around the end of my junior year of high school (im graduated now) I started working out, and it was great for my mental health, I had an eating disorder prior to working out and went from being fat to being skin and bones and about a year into lifting i got noticeably more jacked and i was able to make many friends through the gym and through the confidence i gained working out. Now the gym doesnt do shit for me. Im still confident in public and dont have terrible social anxiety anymore. I have many friends who would never guess i feel like this. I never hang out with them anymore though and the only time i see them is at the gym. I have a job where i work 30-40 hours a week, a girlfriend who i hang out with 2-3x a week and the gym. those are the only things that make up my day. Most of my shifts are around 3-11pm. On days i work i sleep all day until 2:30 get dressed go to work come home and sleep. On most days i dont work i sleep until almost 4pm then hang out with my girl or go to the gym. My dad is not a bad dad, but he expects me to sign up for college classes or some kind of trade and start my life when i barely feel alive anymore. My mom has struggled with things and has taken it out on me as a kid and that has definitely had lasting effects on me, she lives out of state and i visit when i can. Shes great now, much better than when i was a kid. Other than this my life has been easy, middle class raised in the suburbs, parents bought me a brand new car and ive had no real struggle in life.

I know all these atrocities, and I'm forced to sit alone and marinate in them.

I have no friends. Nobody to talk to when my chest tightens and my breathing feels shallow... and I want to cry. So fucking bad... But I can't. I didn't cry when my two pets and grandpa died last year, and the only time I cried was when my best friend ghosted me. He was all I had—all I could trust in. Ever since then I've tried to talk to other students in my grade, but they don't care about me. Maybe I would kill myself if my mom didn't love me. That's my value: To keep someone else happy while I suffer. I'm just one of the  billions of people on earth, and I'm treated like I'm just a number. 

I've felt really nothing except for longing. A longing for someone to accept my mess of emotions and to be there for me when I break. But people don't care about emotions anymore. Not where I go to school. These are hedonists who pretend to be humble. Sometimes I think it's funny. How stupid people can be. I don't smile anymore though.

10kbjqc,1674583066,How can I build new deep friendships in my late 20s after depression and anxiety?,True,"Hi there!  
Lately I've been struggeling with some repercussions of my depression after I got to a more or less normal state again. Back in 2016 after I finished school and started Uni I got depression mixed with anxiety in a pretty bad way over the course of my first semester. It got so bad I couldn't go to Uni any longer and just did nothing in terms of progess at uni. But I actually managed to hold up a facade for my friends and family til the beginning of 2018. When I was with them I tried to act ""normal"", but when I was alone - which was most of the time - I was doing pretty bad with thought spirals, fears of not being enough, feeling worthless and even having suicidal thoughts. You may ask why I did not get help since this phase lastet for almost two years, but I just had immense fear of not being understood. Besides that a big part of my depression trigger was the experience of two one sided loves, where I had been rejected in the last years of my school time. I switched schools for the last three years of school, met new friends there, friends I've felt so close and connected to it did not really match anything I have ever felt at the time. I even fell in love with one of them and got rejected. After that and with us all finishing school the group kinda fell apart, which I always felt at least a bit responsible for, because to be honest I had a hard time letting the girl go and always asked if her feelings changed, which of course they didn't. Fast foward to the present even with the obstacles I am now at the end of my uni years and I can say in general: I'm doing quite good. I reached out to my brother 2018, went to therapy even if just for a short while and managed to get out of this hole. For a short time I went to support group for young people and after a while I met my now girlfriend of almost three years at an online dating app. So over all I can't really 'complain'. I still have days where I feel overwhelmed and like I might fall back into the hole, but this far a few bad days never turned into a few completly dark month or years again, which I am really glad about. To get to the point of me writing this:  
There are two more parts to the story. Out of the group of friends I met after switching schools I stayed in contact with one girl and she was the first person I told about my depression. Over time and because of my fears I always turned to her for help, which got excessive and she having her own life to handle didn't know how to deal with. So this friendship fell apart and now we have no contact and again I always blame myself, my depression and the ""neediness"" caused by it for that. The other thing is while I was going through this long phase and moving to a different city for uni I never managed to meet new friends. New people sure, but never people I formed a bond with that went further than the projects we had to work out for a course at uni for example. I turned 27 in december, about to finish uni and the group of guy friends I have my same age - which I know since early childhood - are all working or like me about to start their careers. But as it seems to me they all managed to meet new friends along their ways and I did not. I am very glad about the long year and in a way very close friends I have and I appreciate them now even more and more, but this group mostly exists as a group with one or two individual friendships in it and while I am in the inner circle of the group I don't have one person in it I really spend that much one on one time with. And as my brother who is a few years older than me had his first child 1 1/2 years ago I realize more and more that our youth is finally ending, which has beautiful parts of course, but I feel like my time to form new meaningful friendships has passed and that the ones I have left will be just less intense, because you dont get to see one another nearly as much as you used to just a few years earlier. So in the end I kinda feel guilty and lonely, because of my depression in these crucial years of exploring new things and people after school I never managed to form new meaningful and deep friendships, which could replace the love I had for the friends I met just a few years earlier when I switched schools.  I even feel that I lost the last close friend of that group because of the depression and the weight I and the mental illness put on the friendship.  
I guess what I am trying to ask is in the end fairly simple: Do you think I am still able to meet people, who dont have ""enough"" friends for the short time they have on hand and form a deep connection with them? As you probably guessed I am shy and not one to meet people easily. I feel like it's almost easier to meet people willing to commit to a new relationship than to a new friendship that isn't supperficial, just like I found it hard to admit it to myself and to articulate it when I lost this one friendship over my depression: A breakup of a friendship can hurt just as much or even more than the breakup of a romantic relationship can. So how can I even meet people not in general, but connect in a deep way as a shy person who needs time to get ""warm"" with new people? Sure you can meet people via shared interests, but I always feel like these things a lot time never turn into something deeper and stay a ""means to an end"" kinda friendship like the people I met at uni for example. There were a people who were kinda nice, but they never talked about doing something together and didn't wanna intrude, especially when I realized they already had plans with other people they knew.   


Would also be nice to hear if anyone can just relate to this stuff.

10karhi,1674581153,Fuck my life,True,"My life sucks. I've been doing nothing these past 3 years, just leeching off of my parents house to stay alive. I stopped attending in college because of financial problems. Got even more depressed because of that. Now even worse because of my insecurities and the feeling of being left behind by your peers. It really feels awful. I tried applying for jobs but it didn't work out because of my low self esteem. I somehow dont show up in interviews because of low confidence in myself. I just spend my day sleeping and playing videogames all day. Very unproductive I should say when I should be working and studying instead. My health is also deteriorating. Got a very bad vision and I think eventually I'll go blind. Also had a mild stroke. And I've been thinking what is there for me to even stay alive. I don't wanna live like that and I just can't do that.

Now I tried to change all of that and went to a healthy diet and regular exercise. Been doing hobbies that keeps my mind at ease too and somehow finding jobs that could help me earn even a little to help in my family too. But eventually stopped since I thought to myself why should I even try, when I will end up going blind anyways, or even get paralyze or end up dead. Like what's the point of all this effort and hardwork, nothing. 

But I tried to still go on anyway with my life since I met my supposedly gf. I was always happy with her. Always looking forward talking to her everyday. We were always there for each other thru ups and downs. She was my sunshine or so I thought. One day she was just crying and told me that she already have a bf even before meeting me. I didnt even know what to feel when I heard her saying that. It felt like I am ruining another relationship without knowing. She told me she didnt love him anymore and the love she got for his bf was already gone years ago but she couldn't just break up with him because he threatens her everytime she talks about break up. It really sucks because I loved her so much and I couldn't do anything about her situation. But I prioritized her situation anyway and disregarded mine for the meantime ik im stupid for that too but I loved her too much. 

Now I don't know what to do anymore. I just wanna end everything. I just wanna rest. Everything is so stressful. Fuck my life. And there's no saying it would get any better either. So yeah, fuck my life. I'm out.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10karhi/fuck_my_life/,shinuorikiteiru,

SUICIDE

SELF HURT

DEPRESSION

ANXIETY

LONELINESS

We all are so familiar with these words but yet so distant from the real meaning and the depth of these terms. “17 year old hangs herself from the ceiling after battling with depression for an year”. “Student commits suicide after not being able to pass entrance exam after trying for 2 years” these headlines are no longer weird or shocking or even eye catching anymore for anyone. Have you ever thought, why would a person ever hurt themself? What even led to the moment that he/she had to hurt themselves, cause a scar not only on their body, their skin; but on their soul, their memories ,their being.

Was it easy for them? How much courage did it take to do the unthinkable? How much pain were they in to do it? Was their reason a reason enough to tarnish their soul? Why couldnt they tell anyone? Why couldnt they get the HELP they needed?

Well, what is HELP? what is DEPRESSION. So many questions! but no definite answer to them

“A group of conditions associated with the elevation or lowering of a person's mood, such as depression or bipolar disorder” This is the definition you would get if you were to google the term. but thats only the scientific non complicated easy understandable definition of the word. the word in itself means soooo much more. more than what a normal person would understand.

I’m just a 16 year old girl right now, who was diagnosed with clinical depression. my family was ofcourse rightly worried about me so they sent me to a therapist to get HELP, after suffering from months on end, after hurting myself more than 2-3 times, crying and weeping in a corner of a room at night when NO ONE knew. after suffering for months there was guilt in their eyes after knowing what i’d done to myself.

I’d have throbbing consistent pain in my head when my parents would fight, and the pain never seemed to reside till the next morning. I could never properly sleep in the nights.

the pain at one point seemed so much, and it was the first time i thought of IT.

i pictured a knife kind of article while the pain came once again while i was crouched in one corner of my room late at night, my elbows on my knees and my hands wrapped around my head, tears which flowed tainting my cheeks. and my teeth biting my lips, hoping that would stop me from picturing anything more than the knife. The pain nearly resided in an hour and i was finally able to get some sleep; an hour before my mom would wake up.

i couldnt stop thinking about the vision (?) the whole day. i thought, how would it have felt if i had hurt myself? would the pain crashing through my skull stop? would it no longer hurt? or hurt less?

i never knew that day that i’d get my answers soon enough.

The first time i hurt myself - how did it feel? i still remember it vividly like its etched in a part of my memories i could never ever erase, that i could never drown in the happiest of memories. The fight had happened an hour ago and the pain had arrived, announcing that my night was going to be a sleepless one yet again. but this time I WAS DONE. i wanted to stop it, so badly. every memory, every bad memory had come crashing down with the pain like a guest, one that no one liked

the same setting, one corner in the room, hands cradling my head, and tears that seemed to know their way now. and then IT CAME. i couldn’t do it. i wanted it to stop. just for once. only this time i swear and i wouldnt cheat again. i pulled myself up, walked up to the washroom. CONFUSION. what should i pick? where should i do it? will this hurt enough? then will my pain stop? just this once please. and i picked up a tweezer. i wasnt scared, i wasnt nervous, i was CONFUSED. i was LOST. whats the next step? what do i do?

before i knew it came again, the tears had found their exit again, my hands had cradled m head again, and i just wanted it to STOP. ‘NO. DONT. JUST THIS ONCE STOP!’

i left out bouts of whimpers as i picked up the tweezer and i started to scratch. just scratch and scratch and scratch. but it wouldnt stop. IT HAD TO. IT HAD TO STOP.

i kept going and there it was, fresh emerging blood. but i wasnt scared or freaked. all i though at the moment was ‘MAYBE IT’LL STOP ANYTIME NOW’ and i kept going.

the evocation that shakes me to this day when i look at the scar on my wrist is IT DIDNT PAIN. my head started to clear again, the pain seemed to shy away and hide; plainly to return back again. but it didnt pain, blood flowed and oh how it did, but it never pain at that point.

Did i do it again? YES. 2 TIMES MORE

Why did i stop?

why cant others stop?

I wake up every day feeling tired and going through the motions. I look around and wonder why I’m the only one who feels this way, even though I should be trying to work doubly hard because my life is probably the least sorted out among my peers. I’ve had a pretty rough ~8 years of schooling before joining the army, having been held back a year for poor performance and still getting bad grades after moving on to the next stage of education. Again, not that I can’t cope, just that I have no motivation to do anything for myself. I still have yet to apply to a university and the applications are closing soon, but I have no idea what I want to study or even work as in the future. The unit I’m in currently is quite physically demanding, my combat fitness is on par with the rest, but my physical fitness is another big problem. I also can’t leave or request to be taken out if I want to, the only way is to actually get injured. Because of being in this unit I only have weekends out of camp, and sometimes not the full weekend. When I do get out I’m so tired from the week’s training that I can’t be bothered to do anything else. I have a loving family and girlfriend and other people who care about me, but I don’t even have the mental capacity to care about them sometimes. Getting counselling and therapy is a huge stigma in my country, and I don’t have time to go or to wait for it to work, so I can’t just go and get treatment whenever I want to. I just can’t seem to find the motivation to go about my daily life. I’m so puzzled about why I feel so unmotivated and I’m really doubtful what treatment can do to help this.

10k9ij6,1674577996,Making People Uncomfortable With My Negativity...,True,"I've always been a very sad person, but I was always able to hide it, still make jokes, be the ""fun friend"" &amp; entertain others or prioritize them (being the therapist friend).

But for the past few years, I've been isolating myself more and more (I have no friends). Now I'm forced to interact with people through work and being back in school (I'm 25). On some days I'm pretty okay at faking it but on others, I just keep quiet (I have ADHD which makes me overly chatty so me being silent seems to irritate people) avoid them, or can't keep my cynicism, pessimism &amp; nihilism inside and I sometimes don't even notice how negative I am but I always read other people's body language &amp; usually don't miss out on their reaction &amp; I can tell how uncomfortable this is to them and how I'm becoming more and more unlikable in their eyes. I used to downplay it in the past but I don't see any sense in that anymore. Lately, I've also noticed how I feel like I'm not even there or ""on autopilot"" so I only notice the impact my words had on people after I've already said it, my brain constantly feels so foggy, like I'm somewhere behind or in the middle of all that mist. It feels like I'm losing control over my body &amp; identity... Some girl I hang out with at school even imitated me (out of context) in a sort of taunting way and it quite frankly shocked &amp; hurt me. I really don't want to be that person. Usually, I would've stayed at home when I already woke up deeply depressed but attending school is now mandatory for me because I've missed out on it so much and for my job, well, I need the money...

I feel very incompetent, alone, and anxious. I know that nobody owes me any kind of sympathy, I know that they don't have to try to understand me and I also know that they will simply only see what they dislike in me but I don't know how to handle this in the long run, if I cannot hide anymore.

But I'd secretly really wish to find someone who could be kind, listen and understand... maybe someone here can relate.

10k93ij,1674576908,Following my passions was a mistake.,True,"I am a civil engineering student from india in my final semester. I took the civil coz of my passion for buildings and infrastructure, particularly transportation. I just fuckin love trains, stations, airplane, airport, road, bridges, tunnels etc and i just wanna. I just fuckin love it. And i followed my passions and took civil in one of the top colleges in India. Now i am in my final yr and I still love civil and transportation Engineering. But ffs what happened respect and dignity. This is the final sem and almost all of my frnds who are in computer science, IT and electrical and electronics are placed with high salary. Complete dumbfucks who took this only bcoz of placement earns more than me. And they literally go there. They get paid more than a monthly salary of a civil engineer as their internship stipend. And they do literally nothin. Like nothing. Atmost some online classes. On the oth hand we civil engineer get send to the field with dangerous conditions and in the heat for internship and we get paid jackshit for that. I had to stay back in the office till 9pm for my internship to complete a work that they gave me. On the oth hand mf gets paid for playing with a PlayStation. 

It's not only. The construction industry itself treats us as shit. We get paid shit and asked to do a lot. We also have shit working hours and conditions. On top of that none are interested in taking fresher coz of ""lack of experience"". Mf where I am I supposed to get experience. And on top of that the ones who do take. Won't take coz a). I had an arrear in first sem and b) my profile and project shows that I might leave the company for higher studies. Like I have done more projects than oths in my class so that means I'll go for highers. And also just bcoz someone had an arrear for a paper in first sem doesn't mean ur shit, but bcoz of that mf won't even look at my profile. On top that i had to deal with stupid boomers and some egoisticl cunts who think civil engineer are ppl who didn't get CS or IT and hence lower than us.

At this pt I just wanna get tf out of India. The thing I understood in India is that if ur a CS/IT Engineer there is nothing for u over here. So rather than get shit on and disrespected for following my passion i need to get tf out of here. I wanna do masters in Civil Engineering and never come back. I am ambitious. I wanted to design public transit system and improve the existing ones. I wanted to be a major name in the industry. And India is not the place until they understand the value of us Civil engineer. Until they understand how valuable we are. Many collegs are planning to stop civil engineering courses since not many takers are there and why would they. 

So i wanted to go out and work in countries who value Civil engineers and the work they do. But my dad isn't much into this idea. And i get him. We r not financially well off to put $ 50k to 70k on the table and I understand that. And i told them I'll go with scholarship and loan. I'll work hard to secure it. But still my dad isn't into this. Especially after my mom got frauded out onlinr and lost a ton of Money. My mom on top of that is diagnosed with Parkinsons we have no clue when the treatments would get expensive and my dad wants to get a job immediately. And thing is I can't support my mom with salary that i'll get being a junior civil engineer and it would take years b4 i could give her a decent treatment. And I can't wait till then. I just don't want my mom to suffer or worse lose her. If i get in a reputed uni in Europe in 2yrs I will be earning €60 to 70k as an entry level engineer. I can treat my mom properly. And both parents can live a comfortable life. But my dad isn't into it. At this pt i feel i am trapped and no where to go. It's like ur in a cage and u can see the key that u can set urself free but u can't reach it. And sucide is becoming more of viable options. This is not my first time i am expressing this. A lots of shit happened b4 to push me here. And i feel i am comming more and more near it as time passes. i feel my life expectancy is commin more and more closser. I don't wanna open up just bcoz i don't wanna scare my frnds and family away from me. That's all i have. The only reason that's preventing me from doin that is my parents and mainly my mom. She can't handle that. She won't. Her Parkinson would accelerate to the pt even my dad can't handle. And i feel all this could have been avoided had i taken CS/IT way back 4yrs back.

When I talk to others I just seem detached from my generation, I can't understand them. And all they hear from me is a scrambled attempt at words, barely making any sense. I awkwardly fake smile, I say phrases that don't exist, my English has withered. This campus kills me, and when I get to my dorm I still have to put up an act. My roommates constantly in the dorm, I can't go depresso with him in here. It doesn't help that I keep on questioning why I'm here.

10k8jjy,1674575491,i don't think i'm okay,True,"i've been at depression rock-bottom since last april. the last year has been the worst of my life. the last month has been the worst of that. the last like ten days have been unbearable.

i was meant to die last year, before last april, before things hit their worst. my best friend made me promise to not do anything, because he'd never be okay. i'm in love with him. i can't hurt him. he knows i love him. he says he loves me, but not the same way. but we've been on-again off-again in a situationship affair anyway. even though he's with someone.

but he just got his gf pregant. he told me he's buying her a $10,000 ring. he said we're not even friends any longer. that it's no fun to talk to someone with depression. that i make him make bad decisions and have made his life worse.

so why should i still stay around for his sake. i think it'd be a relief to him if i were gone.

he's literally the only reason i'm alive. and now he hates me too.

i have to work with him. i have a meeting with him and others in ten minutes. so i just did a shot of tequila at ten am. because i was about to finally cry over everything. and i can't. 

i legitimately do not think i am loveable. or even likeable. or even tolerable.

and the only thing that matters to me in life is human connection.

and i can't have it. even when i try to be focused on others, and never complain, and not be a burden, and make others feel good.

it's not enough.

there's literally no reason for me to be here other than others not having to deal with the discomfort of realizing some people are just better off dead.

the guy who molested me should have killed me. he threatened to. he should have done it.

it would have saved everyone time.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10k8jjy/i_dont_think_im_okay/,tryagainta,

But man the last year and the beginning of this year really gave me a reality check.
It just feels so weird! Waking up and getting out of bed later and later each day, energy just disappearing into thin air.

The job is still interesting but nothing feels fun anymore. All interests and fun activities became pretty much boring and I’m not sure what to do anymore, other than lying in bed and waiting for sleep.

I never had much self esteem to begin with but now it’s really just gone along with self love and any bit of confidence.
Everything feel dragged out, like liquid mercury is sloshing around in my head and thoughts are heavy.
Destructive thoughts spirals happens every day and it’s hard to break through them.

Got no irl friends, a few online but they’re a complete contrast of me and just tell me “I should do sport and change something” 
Sadly they don’t see the massive invisible brick wall which is on my head, keeping me from doing anything.

My doctor gave me a referral to a psychologist, which is good. But sadly the wait time is 6 months..

The only few things which still feel fun is good food, sleep and sadly alcohol. But I’m very cautious with the last one.

Guess I was just screaming into the rn.

10k81g4,1674574139,i feel left out.,True,"I have 3 siblings, im the youngest. My siblings are 18, 14 and 7 years older than me. I dont have childhood memories with them due to age gap. I dont have a nice childhood. I play alone. Sleep alone. My first 2 siblings got babies when i was 4 and 5 years old. So, mostly i have to play with them and they treat me as their sister instead of aunt. Which im ok with. I dont have any say on the household since im the youngest. My parents are busy taking care of my nieces and nephews. Barely noticing me. I got my first barbie doll gift when i was fourteen. Before,my 2nd sibling  accuse me of stealing. She said I am the one who steals some on her hard earned money. She's working overseas btw. And invited me to visit. But i didnt. Im working partime on that time. I may loom like i dont have money, But then things got messy. After few years right before covid. I was so depressed in my life cant even keep a job and always crying wherever i can without knowning the reason. I even cried on a public transporation without even knowing until a stranger offered her handkerchief to me. that time  i even thought of abortion since i was pregnant since i want to end my life. My partner that time cheated on me with different women. And I dont have anyone to talk to. I cant even talk to any of my siblings cause. 1) they dont like me. 2) they maybe think im so proud of my self that I shouldnt be at our house. Then I did something bad. Since they think i steal money before, now im desperate of dealing with my own problem i got accustomed to be there for my self since no one else would. I stoke some money i want to abort my child and end my life eventually making sure that i can plan on how to bury myself.. My 2nd sister is so mad at me since its her who i stile money from its $100. But eventually took it back. I told my mom the reason why, that's the first time i felt the weigh on my chest removed. Of course, my mom being a mom supported me and make sure that i know she understand's me. But then i heard from her that my siblings are plotting something to hurt me physically. Becuase of my mistake. One time, they got mad on my mom cause she tried to help and understand me. Again i didnt use the money i kept it for a day or two then gave it back. And told them that it was me. My mind was blurry and i couldnt think straight. I know its my fault and i accepted it. I told my mom that its ok i will accept anything cause its my fault. It even got to the point that they lash on my mom saying things like, she only wanted money from them. Since they have a good paying job overseas. It hurts me that someone got involved because of me. So i messaged my sister and told her everything. I even told her im really sorry and  to just be mad at me. And not our mom. Cause its my fault anyway. Our mom is not part of it. She just tried to understand my reasoning as some mother always does. But until now. My sibling wont talk to me. Im not invited on any occasion or gatherings. Im not even included on post cards or bithday cards that they got to each other. And recently. My 2nd sister got my brother (3rd child) a bottle of whiskey on his upcoming bday.(its may 9 and mine was may 20th) and everyone else something on her box that she sent to our address. But nothing for me. I guess its my fault that they dont want me and i apologized for that. Im just really sad i dont have any friends. I dont have any siblings to talk to. And just earlier i messaged my mom admiring how close she was on her siblings wondering if i will have that experience as well. Maybe i wont. And will die alone.

10k77bp,1674571902,Is this a normal way to taper off an antidepressant?,True,"I have been taking 50mg sertraline for a few years but I’m currently trying to switch from sertraline to Wellbutrin. My old doctor suggested I start by taking both and then slowly decrease the sertraline dose every week. But when I eventually stopped taking it the withdrawal symptoms were so hard to handle I started taking half a pill again (25mg) with my Wellbutrin daily to get rid of the symptoms. I am seeing a new doctor and she suggested continuing to take the Wellbutrin daily but take half a sertraline every other day (then every two days, every three, etc)  until eventually it’s so spaced out I don’t need it anymore. I took it every other day for two weeks, now I’m taking it every two days and the symptoms are starting to hit. Though not as bad as the other time I tried tapering. 

I’m a bit concerned because everywhere I look I only see information about the original way I was attempting to stop (decreasing the dose gradually). I can’t find anything about this “spaced out” method. Is this common? Or will it just make the withdrawal last longer since I keep giving my body a bit of the sertraline every so often",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10k77bp/is_this_a_normal_way_to_taper_off_an/,anondaisypetals,

She demanded I buy her a switch for Christmas and when I didn't, she huffed off to another part of the house and wouldn't talk to me. When I talked about going on a vacation, she said she couldn't pay to go, I said I couldn't pay for both of us, and she said I could go by myself. When I did exactly that, she again got mad and flew off the handle a week before I was set to get on the plane.

All that to say I still miss her dammit. She was fun when she wasn't demeaning me. I enjoyed spending time with her. She made the house less lonely. She made me reconsider my most basic thoughts about marriage and kids.

When I broke up with her I gave her a letter detailing my issues with the relationship and even said I hope these things can be worked out and maybe we can be back together. She acted like she was open to changing and working on the relationship but then she just texted me a long message basically giving back what I said my issues were and said ""no you."" 

It shouldn't be this hard. She was abusive and she didn't really ever want to work on anything. I just hate what she took from me. Years of love. The person who I'd talk to about inane things. The person who would help when I was sad. Someone who got up and helped when I had my first panic attack.",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10k4bj3/4_years_down_the_drain/,deepdownblu3,

-I don't know what to do with my life career wise. I currently work Frozen/Dairy at Walmart and don't know where to go in next. I make $18.84 and don't have any career aspirations. I don't have any career interests and when I try to read about careers and nothing interests me. I feel like I need a career/job that gives me purpose, because I don't have a purpose. Im just here right now.....existing, and I hate just existing for no reason.

-Im helping my parents with the household. My dad only makes about $1250 with disability and my mom was a housewife who hasn't worked in about 25 years. She's 55 now and has a lot of health problems to the point where she can't work. My parents pay the bills, where I buy all the groceries (about $800-$1200 a month). I don't know what to do for them if I get a girl and decide to move out. I feel helpless. Is there anything my parents could do?

-I weigh 405 pounds and have severe brain fog. I eat a lot of food and drink a lot of Coke Zero to cope with my anxiety with not knowing what to do with life. I also masturbate a lot. The weight part of the reason is why I've never had a girlfriend before. These days females are more likely to pass on bigger dudes and I've never had a gf before. The weight and the bad situation with my parents leave me in a bad spot gf wise. The brain fog is a result of me drinking too many sodas and masturbating too much. I literally can't focus on anything because of my brain fog. I don't even have my drivers license because I'm afraid to forget the rules of the road and mess up. I also haven't pursued any careers due to lack of focusing on anything. 

-Hobbies. I barely have any. I literally work 10pm-7am, sleep, game/watch a movie/YouTube, and then go to work. I used to like watching football/pro wrestling/mma, fishing, watching movies, bowling, etc. I don't do any hobbies that require going out, because I don't have any friends outside of work. I barely focus on tv shows/movies/video games because of my anxiety/brain fog, and depression that leads to me not giving anything a chance. Also I'm not really interested in new hobbies bc of said reasons. Females would probably think I'm boring bc of that. 

Someone please help me. I would greatly appreciate it and would answer any questions that are asked. I'm very bad depressed but I would never hurt myself or anything like that. I would be happy to have possible solutions.

10k3hgi,1674560235,umm... what's going on?,True,"Hi.

This past month or so I seem to have lost all my emotions. All of them. I'm not sad or upset about it, because, well, I can't be. I lost the ability to do that. I can no longer socialise on any level because of it and people are beginning to notice (Parents, classmates, ect.) 

Most of the day I get hit with these waves of depression, as I like to call them. I am just in a shitty state during these. I no longer feel anything, so I wouldn't say I'm in a low mood, but I'm not in good shape. At all.

I found an entry to my journal during one of these depressive states...and I don't even recognise the person who wrote it. The contents of that entry are fucked on a whole 'nother level. I read it every day and just think about it constantly. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before, and I won't lie. It's scary.

Whenever I'm in these states, I truly believe I have a serious problem. Of course I would, look at the state of me. However, in between them, when I feel something that's even close to normalcy, I believe there's nothing wrong with me and that it was just a passing thing. I want to believe that, I truly do, and I think I almost ""gaslight"" myself into thinking that.

Well, until the reality check sets in and another wave hits me.

I don't recognise myself anymore. What the hell happened to me?

I really don’t think many will see/read this but this is the first time and probably the last I’ll be posting on Reddit because well. I’m ready to not be here. To keep things really short. From about 3-18, I experienced all forms off abuse, divorce, the death of a parent, the neglect of the other one, witness to extreme sexual and physical violence as a child into teen years, and was the one who found my mothers dead body after her heart gave out. I was 11 then. 11-18 I was made to be all these things were my fault because I was born, and I would never amount to anything. Well. I over compensated by chasing relationships, having them fail, and I even moved three different states between 18-22. During all this I was hospitalized twice for 5150s, and three other attempts that were stopped in action. At 22 I joined a forestry program and got extremely good at felling trees. I was made a lead quickly, made the training instructor, lead classes of 20 people to fell trees monthly and crushed it. Did that from 22-25, when I decided to try wildland fire. I was good at it, with my saw experience, but I hated the community and the lifestyle. I fell back into my depression and suicidal thoughts, and now became extremely violent towards myself, and to my partner. Whom was the love of my life and the one I was going to marry, even bought a ring, but now that’s out the window. As it should be. She only ever wanted to love me, care for me. She gave me her whole heart and live and gave me back so much of my life that I missed. like a huge Disney trip, vacations, home cooked meals, moved me in with her, took care of me while I made her suffer for literally no reason. She loved me. I loved her, but I made the choices to let my abuse happen. I do not want sympathy here. I am an abuser, and I promised myself I would never become my childhood but, here I am. Now I am jobless, homeless, rightfully single, my family has disowned me, and I absolutely out right hate myself with so much rage. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I don’t want to cause anymore pain. But if I’m alive, I know I just will repeat this cycle. There is no redemption for me, I do not have a respectable future, people can not change their behaviors once they happen. I have lost, and it is my fault. My only redemption is I have never been sexually abusive or violent. So, I really do think it’s my time.

Mum and I got home from work at our respective times and found him dead in February 2020. I've been taking care of my mother as she mourned; my mourning has been coming out randomly; I cry in my sleep and when I hear soft instrumental music. I hurt a lot because I took care of him in place of our absent father.

2007 began a 13-year battle (16-30 years old) with a chronic condition with symptoms including being prone to infection, being contagious, projective discharge of blood/pus from my scalp, heavy blood loss, fevers, etc. all caused by antibiotics. Due to the chronic pain that prescription painkillers couldn't fix, I prayed for death every day. After spending thousands of pounds on potential cures, which were all unsuccessful, I was cured through faith alone. 

now I'm cured but can't move on, I had no life before the condition, and of cause no life during the health problem, so at 30+, I'm attempting to begin a life but keep believing I will die soon so I can't move on.

I tried BetterHelp for 8+ months, but the technical issues kept giving me anxiety.

I wanted food, I only want fastfood, regardless, I find myself just ithinking a lot of death and  what ifs, knowing I'll never suicide. I digress tho. I managed to sleep until around 11pm. I think it was easier to sleep because I had no energy. I woke up feeling like a mess. Ears ringing. Realizing the fact that I have tinnitus I just tune it out.

I feel like most people at least want to have an intimate group of friends, a respectable job, fun hobbies, things like that. But I often find myself wondering, do I really want close friends? Do I want to feel shitty every time I decline their calls and ignore their texts in the midst of a month long episode of depression? Or become known as unreliable when I start flaking on them because my anxiety is bad for seemingly no reason? Do I want to rely and someone else and for them to rely on me? Would I rather just be a selfish loner? I'm convinced if I had a group of friends that I regularly hang out with, it would eventually get to the point where they hate me as much as I hate myself. 

As for careers and hobbies, nothing interests me as much as I think it should. The most I feel is ""oh that's interesting... anyway"", I never actually have the motivation or interest to dive into anything since...the desire just isn't there. So where does that leave me? Working at a job I either hate or am mindlessly suffering through like a robot, coming home to distract myself with videogames and YouTube the same way I have for the last 8 years, sleeping and repeat. That's no way to live. I already did that through all of my teens, except it was easy then. I didn't have any responsibilities and always thought ""I'll figure it out, I have time"" when I thought about my future.

10k2k24,1674556452,I can't keep my emotions under control outside,True,"Hello community, 

I hope you had a balanced day today so far:) Unfortunately I feel pretty off and since my therapist can't talk right now, I needed someone to talk to. English is not my mother tongue so please excuse some writing mistakes. 

If you have the capacity and want to read about my situation I'm thankful. Since theres a lot going on emotionally with me, this will be a longer one: 

Anxiety isn't new to me. Since years I've had depression and a diagnosed anxiety disorder. But although therapy helped me tremendously in some ways, in other areas it just seems to get worse each year. 

**My situation this year:** 

Life occurrences: I have an okay relationship with my parents. I'm almost in my mid twenties, in the middle of my final exams to graduate university and I've been in a lesbian relationship with a wonderful woman since one year. Since my parents are from Russian heritage this was something they had to fight with for years now, but they're slowly getting there. 

There was some other emotional trauma with them but I'm thankful they are in my life and I know they love me in their way and do as best as they can. Still it's some friction going on between us. Last week they told the rest of my relatives about my relationship. It went well (according to them) in terms that I can still attend family gatherings. Still I was very hurt by the way I was told ( in a shopping mall) and the way my feelings were invalidated. My parents couldn't understand why I was crying and why I felt overlooked when they didn't ask me beforehand (it also triggered a bit the mentioned emotional trauma since they were loving parents in general, but very personality forming/demanding parents, that often didn't listen to my emotional needs.) 

I felt extremely exhausted that evening and I cancelled my piano lesson that week. My teacher wasn't amused, because I need the lessons to pass my final exams at university. 

**Symptoms**: This year and the past 6 months I have not so much struggled with depression and more with kind of mild depersonalization. It's like everything just passes by and honestly it's frightening sometimes.

I can hardly concentrate and procrastinate till I'm getting emormously stressed. I'm trying hard, but still-  my mind is slipping through my fingers. 

I tried to practice piano but I just completely forgot about it this week. It's like I can't even remember things properly and It's making me anxious. I really need to get my shit together otherwise I can't get my degree. 

I eat very often, because I forgot how much I ate, forget what I look like in pictures or the mirror (it feels plain weird looking at myself/ hearing myself talk) and forget to look up essential stuff (I lost track about my finances sometimes, always have to double check time/appointments, forget what someone just said to me in a blink, I don't have any presentable jeans anymore because my last ones ripped and I just always simply couldn't bring myself to buy a new one. Since realizing that I'm on it though) 

 *Does someone have tips how to get things done in this kind of cloudy mindset or how to get out of this cloudy mindset? Does someone has some similar experiences? What caused this?*   

**What happened today:** 

Why I'm writing this is because I feel overwhelmed and guilty. It might seem like a small instance but for me it was kind of hard.

Today I had my piano lesson after I cancelled my last one. My teacher wants the best results for me. He's lovely in his way but a bit chaotic and wasn't in a good mood today. I tried to play my songs but failed of course, since I didn't practice. My teacher was hectic and got louder and I just completely had a crying melt down in front of him. He asked what was wrong and because I didn't know better and why I was crying I said it's because my family isn't accepting of my relationship with a woman. I mean it is a factor why I felt off but I don't think it's necessarily why I cried. 

He interpreted it that my parents weren't accepting and tried to give me advice. I didn't correct him that it was actually my relatives and not my parents, because honestly I just wanted the situation to be over and didn't want to talk about it more. I know it might feel silly, but I feel so guilty because my mom is trying so hard to grow and is on the verge of accepting me. She grew up differently and is just still struggling. 

I feel like I used my trauma coming out to my parents 2 years ago as an excuse today. I feel like I'm just staying in a victim mentality. I wanted to take responsibility but used my trauma (not even a recent incident) as an explanation. I feel like a bad person that bad-mouthes their parents to save their own ass, and I am really sorry. And I feel bad because I cried about such a small thing and made it such a big one. I want to get over it quickly and move on and still my mind comes back to it. 

Once I stepped out of that room with him and went home I could only remember pieces of what happened again. I'm just plain confused. 

*How do I sort my thoughts in a situation like this and how do I learn to better my ability in taking responsibility and don't hurt other peoples reputation or feelings?* 

If you have read until here thank you for your time and patience. This thread might have been a bit chaotic but it's just hard to express myself right now and tell whats going on exactly emotionally. The reasons to cry might also have roots in a deeper unconscious concept I might not know of yet, till I can see from a more neutral stand-point that just crying because I didn't practice piano is a bit random. 

Thank you so much already, since I feel a bit more sorted out and clear. 

I hope ya'll have a nice week!",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10k2k24/i_cant_keep_my_emotions_under_control_outside/,CharmingMine8291,

I thought I'd be good this year but I'm starting to wonder if everything I've tried only succeeded in pushing my problems down and now they're coming out. I have to go back to school a month from now and I don't know if I'll actually be able to hold on.

I believe we both got tired of it so maybe they were relieved. I'd like to think I was too for a few days and then the fact that it was final and I don't have anyone finally hit me and now I keep wishing that things were different, that for once I could have a friendship that lasted, that I could be someone people would want to fight for, that I wasn't so easy to toss away, that if there really is a god up there, I could be one of his favorites. I see things that other people have that I never will. I'm only 20 and I'm trying to make peace with the fact that I'll never be able to be in a relationship, I'll never get married or have kids and that even if I did manage to do any of that, that I'd be horrible at it. I'm not easy to love and I'm a total mess. Everything I do feels like taking two steps forward and ten steps back, each and every time. I haven't felt this horrible since highschool and I haven't been alone like this in a long time, the year just started and I already want everything to end",1,1.0,0,/r/depression/comments/10k1jm9/im_sick_and_im_tired/,ThrowAWay-854,
